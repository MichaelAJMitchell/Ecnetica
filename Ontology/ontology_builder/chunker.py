Text Chunker - Modular text chunking with context awareness

This module handles the critical task of breaking large documents into manageable
pieces for LLM processing. It implements context-aware chunking that preserves
the relationships between concepts that might span multiple chunks.
"""

class TextChunker:
    """
    Breaks large text documents into manageable chunks while preserving context.
    
    LLMs have token limits, so large documents must be split into smaller pieces.
    This class ensures that chunks are created intelligently to maintain context
    and prevent important mathematical concepts from being split across boundaries.

        Initialize the chunker with configurable chunk and overlap sizes.

            chunk_size: Maximum characters per chunk (default: 1M characters)
            overlap_size: Number of characters to overlap between chunks (default: 200K)
            
        The overlap ensures that concepts at chunk boundaries aren't lost and

        Create context-aware text chunks from a large document.
        
        This method splits text into chunks while ensuring that:
        1. No chunk exceeds the maximum size limit
        2. Adjacent chunks have sufficient overlap for context
        3. Chunks are created at natural break points when possible
