Section 1.1  Irrational numbers   
In your study of maths so far, you will have met these number systems:
 (i) Natural numbers: N  !  {1, 2, 3, 4, ………} … whole positive numbers.
 (ii) Integers: Z  !  {…… " 3,  " 2,  " 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ……} … whole, positive and negative 
numbers including zero.
 (iii) Rational numbers: Q  !  {  a   _  
b   |   a ,  b   !   Z ,  b   #  0}, i.e. fractions, e.g.   1   _  
2   ,   7   _

2    etc.
Note:  The set Q includes decimals that can be written as fractions.
If we try to solve the equation  x 2   $  2  !  7, we get
 
x 2   !  7  "  2  !  5
 
x   !    √

5 is a number that is not an element of any of the above sets of numbers.
Using a calculator, we ﬁnd   √
__
 
5  !  2.236067978… …, a non-repeating, non-terminating decimal.
Because   √

Since there can be no numbers common to the rational and irrational sets, together the sets 
of natural numbers, integers, rational and irrational numbers form the  partitioned  set of Real 
numbers (R). 
It is clear that  N   #   Z   #   Q .
Also, R \ Q  !  the set of irrational numbers.
Note:  Not all square roots are irrational numbers, e.g.   √

4  !  2,   √

9  !  3 etc.
As outlined in the section on surds, irrational numbers can be simpliﬁed by ﬁnding a pair of 
factors, one factor of which is a perfect square.

Numbers such as  " 1  $   i  are called  complex numbers  and are normally denoted by the letter  z .
A complex number such as  z   !  3  $  6 i , has two parts (dimensions); a  real part  and an 
imaginary part .
The ﬁrst part of this complex number is the real constant 3.
The second part of this complex number is imaginary; the real constant 6 multiplied by  i .
3 is referred to as the real part and is given by  Re( z )   $   3 .
6 is referred to as the imaginary part and is given  
by  Im( z )   $   6 .
The set of complex numbers is denoted by  C .

Adding and subtracting complex numbers  
When adding or subtracting complex numbers, we add (or subtract) the real and imaginary 
parts separately.
For example: (i) (4  $  3 i )  $  (3  "  2 i )  !  4  $  3 i   $  3  "  2 i
 
  
!  (4  $  3)  $  (3 i   "  2 i )
 
  
!  7  $   i

Section 1.3  Division and Equality of complex numbers   
Complex numbers can be divided by a real number as follows.

To divide a complex number by another non-real complex number, we must change the 
denominator into a real number using a  complex conjugate .
Complex conjugate  
Given any complex number  z   !   a   $   bi , then the complex conjugate of  z , written  
_   z   , is  a   "   bi .
For example, if  z   !  3  $  4 i ,
 
then   _   z  !  3  "  4 i , where   _   z  is the complex conjugate of  z .

Using the complex conjugate, we can divide complex numbers as shown in the  
following example.
Equality of complex numbers  
For two complex numbers to be equal, their real parts must be equal and their imaginary 
parts must be equal.
If ( x   $  2)  $  4 i  
!  
6  $  ( y   "  2) i ,
then  x   $  2  !  6 and 
4  !   y   "  2
 
⇒   x   !  4 and 
6  !   y
If   a   $   bi

then   a   !   x  
and

Section 1.4  Argand diagram – Modulus   
The  Argand diagram  gives a geometric representation of a complex number as a point in  
the complex plane.
Real numbers can be plotted on a single number line but complex numbers, with two parts 
consisting of a real part and an imaginary part, need a plane of points to represent them.
The complex plane is similar to the Cartesian  
plane, with the real part Re( z ) of a complex  
number represented by the  x -axis, and the  
imaginary part Im ( z ) represented by the  y -axis.
In this diagram we have plotted the  
complex numbers
 
(i)  z 1   !  5  $  2 i
 
(ii)  z 2   !  0  $  4 i   !  4 i
 (iii)  z 3   !  2  $  0 i   !  2
 (iv)  z 4   !   " 2  "  4 i
 
(v)   _   z  1   !  5  "  2 i
Modulus of a complex number  
The  modulus  of a complex number is the distance from the origin to the point in the  
plane representing the number.

 investigate the 
conditions under which  | z 1   $   z 2 |   !   | z 1 |   $   | z 2 | .
Section 1.5  Transformations of complex numbers   
1. Multiplying a complex number by a real number
If a complex number  z 1  !  3  $  2 i  is multiplied by 4,
we get 4 z 1  !  4( 3  $  2 i )  !  12  $  8 i .
The real part is increased by a factor of 4 and the 
imaginary part is also increased by a factor of 4.
The complex number appears to be  stretched   
along a line from the origin by a factor of 4.
For example, 3  $  2 i  is mapped onto 12  $  8 i .

! 5  #  6 i
! 2.5  #  3 i
! 3  !   i
3  #   i
If the complex number is multiplied by   1   _  
2   , a  contraction  occurs. 
For example,   ( " 5  $  6 i ) is mapped onto  " 2.5  $  3 i .
Multiplying by ( " 1)  changes the direction , that is, the number is reﬂected through  
the origin. For example, (3  $   i )  &  ( " 1) is mapped onto  " 3  "   i .
If   z   !   x   $   iy , then the transformation  az  has the following results:
 
(i)  | a |   (  1, results in stretching away from the origin
 (ii) 0  )   | a |   )  1, results in a contraction towards the origin
 (iii) a  )  0, then  az  is reﬂected in the origin and stretched or contracted as in (i) or (ii)
2. Adding complex numbers
 
(i) When a complex number  z  is added separately  
to other complex numbers –  z 1 ,  z 2 ,  z 3  –  
it creates a  translation of the plane.
Let 
z   !   " 2  $  3 i
and  z 1   !  3  $  2 i ,   z 2  !  1  $  4 i ,   z 3  !  2  "  2 i .
Then  z   $   z 1   !   " 2  $  3 i   $  3  $  2 i   !  1  $  5 i
 
z   $   z 2  !   " 2  $  3 i   $  1  $  4 i   !   " 1  $  7 i
 
z   $   z 3  !   " 2  $  3 i   $  2  "  2 i   !   i
Notice that the complex number  z 1   translates to  z 1   $   z .
 
Translation mapping  z 1  
  z 1 $   z
 
(ii) When  z 1  is added to  z 2  to create the new complex number ( z 1   $   z 2 ), the three 
complex numbers form a parallelogram with the origin (0  $  0 i ).

Let     z 1   !   " 2  $  2 i  and  z 2  !  3  $  2 i ,
then  z 1   $   z 2   !   " 2  $  2 i   $  3  $  2 i  
!  1 $  4 i .
0  $  0 i ,  " 2  $  2 i , 3  $  2 i  and  
1  $  4 i  form a parallelogram,  
as shown.
3. Multiplying complex numbers 
 
(i)  When a complex number such as 4  $   i  
is multiplied by  i , the complex number 
rotates anti-clockwise about the origin 
by a quarter of a turn.
For example, (4  $   i ). i   !  4 i   $   i   2
 
  !  4 i   "  1 
 
  !    " 1  $  4 i  
… a rotation of 90°
Also, (4  $   i )( i   2 )  !  (4  $   i )( i )( i ) 
 
( " 1  $  4 i )( i )  !   " i   $  4 i   2
 
  !   " i   "  4
 
  !    " 4  "   i 
… a rotation of 180° 
Note :  
( " 4  "   i )( " i )  !   $ 4 i   $   i   2
 
  !   $ 4 i   "  1 
 
  !    " 1  $  4 i  
… a rotation of  " 90°     
z   &   i  ,  z  rotates by 90°
z   &  ( i ) 2  ,  z  rotates by 180°
z   &  ( i ) 3  ,  z  rotates by 270°
z   &  ( i ) 4  ,  z  rotates by 360°
z   &  ( " i ) ,  z  rotates by ( " 90°)
 (ii)  When  z 1   !  2  $   i  is multiplied by  z 2   !  3 $   i , the product can be seen as a 
combination of a stretching and rotation transformation as follows.
 z 1 z 2  !  (2  $   i )(3  $   i ) 
 
  !  2(3  $   i )  $   i (3  $   i )
2(3  $   i ) produces a  stretching effect 
from (3  $   i ) to 6  $  2 i .
i (3  $   i ) produces  a rotation  of 90 o 
from (3  $   i ) to  " 1  $  3 i . 
 2(3  $   i )  $   i (3  $   i )  !  6  $  2 i   $  3 i   "  1
 
  !  5  $  5 i
This combines both transformations.

Section 1.6  Conjugate roots theorem   
When dealing with complex numbers, it is usual to use  z  instead of  x  as a variable.  
The quadratic equation then takes the form  az 2   %   bz   %   c   $   0 .
Consider the quadratic equation  z 2   $  2 z   $  2  !  0.
Using the quadratic formula where  a   !  1,  b   !  2 and  c   !  2.

The roots of this equation are  z 1   !   " 1  $   i  and  z 2   !   " 1  "   i  which we note are the  
complex conjugates of each other.
The sum of the roots  !  ( " 1  $   i )  $  ( " 1  "   i )  !   " 2 (a real number).
The product of the roots  !  ( " 1  $   i )( " 1  "   i )  !  1  $   i   "   i   "   i   2

!   z 2   $  2 z   $  2  !  0.
Therefore, the roots of a quadratic equation with real coefﬁcients occur in conjugate pairs.

--- Page 23 ---

We can now generalise this result to include all polynomials with real coefﬁcients and  
state the conjugate roots theorem as follows:
Conjugate roots theorem
If  z  is a root of  az n   $   bz n " 1   $  .…  dz   $   c   !  0 where  a ,  b ,  c ,  d , …. are all  !   R , 
then   _   z  is also a root of this equation.

Section 1.9  De Moivre’s theorem  
In the previous section, we saw that
 
(cos  *   $   i  sin  * )(cos  *   $   i  sin  * )  !  cos( *   $   * )  $   i  sin( *   $   * )
 
  !  cos 2 *   $   i  sin 2 *
That is 
(cos  *   $   i  sin  * ) 2   !  cos 2 *   $   i  sin 2 *
Also 
(cos  *   $   i  sin  * ) 3   !  cos 3 *   $   i  sin 3 *
The general case of this result is known as  de Moivre’s theorem .
De Moivre’s theorem  
(cos  *   $   i  sin  * ) n   !  cos  n *   $   i  sin  n * , 
  for all real values of  n .

--- Page 32 ---

Proof of de Moivre’s Theorem by Induction  
When  n  is a positive integer, prove (cos  *   $   i  sin  * ) n   !  (cos  n *   $   i  sin  n * )
 (i) Let  n   !  1  ⇒  (cos  *   $   i  sin  * ) 1   !  cos  *   $   i  sin  *  … which is true
 (ii) Assume that (cos  *   $   i  sin  * ) k   !  cos  k *   $   i  sin  k *
 (iii) Prove true for  n   !   k   $  1, i.e.,
(cos  *   $   i  sin  * ) k   $  1   !   [cos( k   $  1) *   $   i  sin( k   $  1) * ]
Proof: (cos  *   $   i  sin  * ) k   $  1   !  (cos  *   $   i  sin  * ) k  (cos  *   $   i  sin  * )
 
!  (cos  k *   $   i  sin  k * )(cos  *   $   i  sin  * )… assumed
!  cos  k *  cos  *   $   i  cos  k *  sin  *   $   i  sin  k *  cos  *   "  sin  k *  sin  *
!  cos  k *  cos  *   "  sin  k *  sin  *   $   i (cos  k *  sin  *   $  sin  k *  cos  * )
!  cos ( k   $  1) *   $   i  sin ( k   $  1) *
Therefore, if it is true for  n   !   k , it is true for  n   !   k   $  1.
But it is true for  n   !  1.
Thus, it is true for  n   !  1  $  1  !   2.
Therefore, the theorem is true for  n   !  1, 2, 3, …. i.e.  n   !   N .
If 
z   !   r  (cos  *   $   i  sin  * ), then using de Moivre’s Theorem:
 
z n   !  [ r (cos  *   $   i  sin  * )] n
 
  !   r n (cos  n *   $   i  sin  n * ) for all  n   !   N .

Section 1.10  Applications of de Moivre’s Theorem  
Simplifying expressions of the form (cos  &   '   i  sin  & ) n   
de Moivre’s theorem applies to (cos  *   $   i  sin  * ) and not to (cos  *   "   i  sin  * ).
However, since  "  sin  *   !  sin ( "* ) and cos  *   !  cos ( "* ),
then 
cos  *   "   i  sin  *   !  cos ( "* )  $   i  sin ( "* ).
Hence, (cos  *   "   i  sin  * ) n   !  [cos ( "* )  $   i  sin ( "* )] n
 
  !  [cos ( " n * )  $   i  sin ( " n * )]

To use de Moivre’s theorem to ﬁnd the  n th root of a complex number, we need to express the

Because the trigonometric functions cosine and sine are periodic functions, with period 2 % , 
 cos  *   !  cos( *   $  2 n % ) and

Section 2.1  Enlargements   
In this diagram the rectangle A ! B ! C ! D !  is an  enlargement  of the rectangle ABCD.
Here   | AB |   "  3 and  | A ! B ! |   "  9
 
| AD |   "  2 and  | A ! D ! |   "  6
The sides of the rectangle A ! B ! C ! D !

of the rectangle ABCD.  
Here the  scale factor  is  3 .

Since the scale factor is 2,  | A ! B ! |   "  2 | AB | ,  | A ! C ! |   "  2 | AC |  and  | B ! C ! |   "  2 | BC | .

Geometry 2: Enlargements 
and Constructions

--- Page 44 ---

The given triangle ABC is called the  object .
The triangle A ! B ! C !  is called the  image .
The dotted lines are called guidelines or  rays .
Drawing enlargements
To construct the image of a given ﬁgure under an enlargement, we need
 (i) the centre of enlargement
 (ii) the scale factor of the enlargement.
The diagram on the right shows a square ABCD  
and a centre of enlargement O. 
We will now enlarge ABCD with O as centre  
of enlargement and scale factor 3.
To ﬁnd the image of A, we join O to A and  
continue to A !  so that  | OA ! |   "  3 | OA | . 
Similarly, join O to B and continue to B !  so that  | OB ! |   "  3 | OB | .
Repeat the process for the points C and D.
The square A ! B ! C ! D !  is the image of the square ABCD.
Since the scale factor is 3,  | A ! B ! |   "  3 | AB |  and  | A ! D ! |   "  3 | AD | .
When a vertex is the centre of enlargement
The diagrams below show how to enlarge the shape ABCD by a scale factor of 2 using A as 
the centre of enlargement.

In the ﬁnal ﬁgure,  | AB ! |   "  2 | AB | ,  | AD ! |   "  2 | AD |  and  | AC ! |   "  2 | AC | .
The diagram on the right shows an enlargement where the  
centre of enlargement, X, is inside the ﬁgure.
In this enlargement, the scale factor is 2.
Draw the line [XA] and extend it so that  | XA ! |   "  2 | XA | .
Extend [XB] so that  | XB ! |   "  2 | XB | .

Repeat for [XC].
Each side of the enlarged triangle A ! B ! C !  is twice the length of the corresponding side in ABC.
For any enlargement, the scale factor is found by  
dividing the length of the image side by the length  
of the corresponding object side.
Enlargements with a Scale Factor less than 1
An enlargement with a scale factor less than 1 produces a smaller ﬁgure nearer to the centre 
of enlargement.
In the ﬁgure below, where A ! B ! C !  is the image of ABC under an enlargement, the scale 
factor is   1   _  
2   .
Thus  | OA ! |   "    1   _  
2   | OA |  and  | A ! B ! |   "    1   _  
2   | AB | .
If the scale factor is  k , then
 (i) if  k   #  1, the ﬁgure is enlarged
 (ii) if  k   $  1, the ﬁgure is reduced.
When the scale factor is a positive fraction  
less than 1, the result is a reduction of  
the given ﬁgure.
Finding the centre of enlargement
When a ﬁgure and its enlargement are given, then the centre of enlargement is found by 
joining two sets of corresponding points and continuing the lines until they meet.
In the diagram on the right, A ! A and C ! C meet at O.  
The centre of enlargement is this point, O.

Enlargement and area
The rectangle on the right is an enlargement of 
the rectangle on the left. The scale factor of  
the enlargement is  k .
The area of the enlarged ﬁgure is  k 2  (area)  
of the given ﬁgure.
This illustrates an important  
general rule for all similar shapes.

Section 2.2  Constructions   
In your study of constructions for the Junior Cycle, you will have learned:
•  How to bisect a line segment
•  How to bisect an angle
•  How to construct various triangles
•  How to draw parallel and perpendicular lines.
In this section we will deal with seven new constructions 
that are on the Leaving Certiﬁcate course as well as the 
application of these constructions to real-life situations. 
For these constructions you will need a compass, straight 
edge and protractor.
When you use a compass you 
must leave the construction 
arcs as evidence that you have 
used the correct method.

and the measures of the angles
The instructions below show how to construct a parallelogram ABCD where  | AB |   "  3.5 cm,  
| AD |   "  4 cm and  |∠ DAB |   "  55°.
In an equilateral triangle, all the sides

Place set square along the line AB. 
Use a ruler to slide the set square 
up to the point D. Draw a line 
through D parallel to AB.
Use a compass with a radius 
of 3.5 cm (the same as  | AB | ) to 
draw an arc on the line.  | DC |   "

required parallelogram.
Circles and triangles
O
O
The  circumcircle  of a triangle is the circle 
which passes through the three vertices, as 
shown. 
The centre, O, of this circle is called the 
circumcentre  of the triangle.
A circle inscribed in a triangle such that all 
three sides touch the circle is called the  incircle  
of the triangle. The centre of the incircle is 
called the  incentre  of the triangle. In the ﬁgure 
above, O is the incentre.
The construction of the circumcircle and incircle of a triangle will involve two constructions 
that you studied for your Junior Certiﬁcate examination.
The diagrams shown below will help you recall the steps involved in doing these 
constructions.

perpendicular from I to the line YZ. 
The perpendicular meets YZ at H. 
With  | IH |  as radius, draw a circle to 
touch the three sides. 
This is the incircle of the triangle XYZ.

6. How to construct the centroid of a triangle
The line segment joining the vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side is called a 
median .
In the triangle below, [XM] is a median.

7. How to construct the orthocentre of a triangle
The perpendicular line segment drawn from the vertex of  
a triangle to the opposite side is called an  altitude .
The point of intersection of the three altitudes

Any point on this bisector is  
equidistant from the arms of  
the angle.  | XY |   "   | XZ | .

How do we ﬁnd a point that is the same distance  
from all three points?

Section 3.1  Antidiﬀerentiation   
Consider the equation  y   !   x 2 .
Differentiating, we get   d y  
___  
d x   !  2 x .
2 x  is the derivative of the function  y   !   x 2 .
From this we can see that when given the derivative 2 x , we can write down the equation  
of the function, i.e.  y   !   x 2 .
The process of ﬁnding a function from its derivative is called  antidifferentiation .
Now consider the functions shown:   y   !   x 2 ,  y   !   x 2   "  1 and  y   !   x 2   "  2. 
The derivative of each of these functions is   d y  
___  
d x   !  2 x , 
as represented by the line shown in red.
The expressions  x 2 ,  x 2   "  1 and  x 2   "  2 are said to be  antiderivatives  of 2 x .

possibilities for  y , all of the form  y   !   x 2   "   c , where  c  is an unknown constant.
We use the notation  ∫ 2 x   d x   !   x 2   "   c  to state that ‘the general antiderivative of 2 x  with 
respect to  x  is  x 2   "   c ’.

From the examples above, we can see that  antidifferentiation  is the reverse  
of differentiation.
Antidifferentiation is more commonly called  integration .
If  f   # ( x ) is the derivative of  f  ( x ), then  ∫ f   # ( x ) d x   !   f  ( x )  "   c .
If   d y  
___  
d x   is the derivative of  y , then  ∫    ( "  d y  
___  
d x   )   d x   !   y   "   c .
Now consider the following functions and their derivatives:
f  ( x )  !   x 2   ⇒   f   # ( x )  !  2 x
f  ( x )  !   x 3   ⇒   f   # ( x )  !  3 x 2
f  ( x )  !   x 7   ⇒   f   # ( x )  !  7 x 6
   …………
Reversing this process, we have
∫ 2 x  d x   !   x 2   ⇒   ∫ x  d x   !    1   _  
2   x 2   "   c
∫ 3 x 2  d x   !   x 3   ⇒   ∫ x 2  d x   !    1   _

∫ 7 x 6  d x   !   x 7   ⇒   ∫ x 6  d x   !    1   _  
7   x 7   "   c
    …………
From this pattern, we can see that reversing the rule for differentiation produces a rule  
for integration as follows:
In general,  ∫ x n  d x   !    x n   "  1  
_____  
n   "  1   "   c ,  n   $   % 1
In words
Here are some useful results for integrating expressions that follow from the  
corresponding results for differentiation.
1.   ∫ af  ( x ) d x   !   a ∫ f  ( x ) d x , that is, any constant factor may be taken outside the integral sign.
2.   ∫ (  f  ( x )  "   g ( x )) d x   !   ∫ f  ( x ) d x   "   ∫ g ( x ) d x  … integrate each term separately.
3.   ∫ a  d x   !   ax   "   c , since   d  
___  
d x   ( ax   "   c )  !   a , where  a  is a constant.
To integrate a power of  x , increase the power 
by 1 and divide by the new power.

--- Page 68 ---

To integrate a function  f  ( x ) with respect to  x , we write
∫ f  ( x )d x .
We read this as ‘the integral of  f  ( x ) with respect to  x ’.
The function to be integrated, i.e.  f  ( x ) , is called the  integrand .
Some expressions are not in the form  ax n  or are not written as a sum or difference of 
functions of this form. In these cases, it is necessary to change the integrand so that each  
term is in the form  ax n .

--- Page 69 ---

Finding the constant of integration  
Each of the examples above contain an arbitrary constant  c .
This arbitrary constant is generally called the  constant of integration .
This constant of integration can be found if further information about the function is given.
This is illustrated in the following example.

Section 3.3  Applications of integration   
In our study of differential calculus, we learned that in an equation of the type
s   !  2 t 2   %  3 t   "  4,
s  represents the displacement of a body from some ﬁxed origin after  t  seconds.
We also learned that   d s  
___  
d t    represents the speed or velocity  v .
The acceleration,  a , of a body is deﬁned as the rate of change of the velocity with  
respect to time,
that is,   d v  
___  
d t    !   a  or  d v  
___  
d t    !   d 2 s  
___  
d t 2   .
Accordingly displacement, velocity and acceleration are linked together by the process of 
differentiation with respect to time.
In reverse order,  a ,  v  and  s  are linked together by integration.
If we integrate an expression for the acceleration of a body with respect to time, we obtain  
an expression for the velocity of the body.
This is summarised diagramatically

can be used to ﬁnd the area,  A , between a  
curve  y   !   f  ( x ) and the  x -axis from  x   !   a   
to  x   !   b , as represented by the shaded area  
in the diagram on the right.
One way to estimate the area would be to divide it into a large number of rectangular strips, 
as shown below. Since each of these strips approximates to a rectangle, the sum of the areas 
of those rectangles gives an approximate value for  A .

We will now consider one such rectangle, as shown on the right above.
Let the area under the curve from  x   !   a  to  x   !   x  be  A ( x ), and the area from  x   !   a  to  
x   !   x   "   h  be  A ( x   "   h ).
The area of the narrow (shaded) strip is approximately equal to  h .  f  ( x )
⇒   A ( x   "   h )  %   A ( x )  !   f  ( x ). h
⇒    A ( x   "   h )  %   A ( x )

___  
d x    !   f  ( x )
⇒  d A   !   f  ( x ) d x
⇒   A   !   ∫   f  ( x ) d x
Thus the integral of the function  y   !   f  ( x ) gives the area function  A ( x ).
If we substitute  b  and  a  for  x , we get the area between the curve, the  x -axis and  
the lines  x   !   b  and  x   !   a .

If  y  !  f  ( x ), then  f  " ( a ) gives the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point where  x   !   a .
Thus, to ﬁnd the equation of the tangent to a curve at the point ( x 1  ,  y 1 ):

Section 4.2   Stationary points   
In the diagram below, the tangents to the curve at the points A and B are parallel to

In the curve above, A and B are stationary points and they are also  turning points .
The turning point at A is called a  local maximum point , since the value of the function at this 
point exceeds all values of the function immediately to the right or left of A.
A maximum value of a function is not necessarily the greatest value of the function.  
This is illustrated in the curve above where the value of the function at C is greater than the 
value of the function at A.
The turning point at B above is called a  minimum turning point  or simply a  local minimum .
The following steps should be used to ﬁnd the turning points of a curve:
 
(i) ﬁnd   d y  
___  
d x   of the function
 
(ii) let   d y  
___

 (iii) for each value of  x , ﬁnd the corresponding value for  y .

As the point A is approached from the left, the slope of the curve is positive but decreasing; 
at A, the slope is zero, and to the right of A, the slope is negative. Thus, as we go through the 
point A, the slope of the curve changes from positive to negative (i.e. is decreasing). 
Thus, the rate of change of   d y  
___  
d x    ( ! i.e.  d 2 y

d x 2   )  is negative.
⇒    d 2 y

d x 2  is negative at a maximum turning point.
Similarly, at the point B, the slope of the curve changes from negative to positive, that is,  
it is increasing.
Thus, the rate of change of   d y  
___  
d x    ( ! i.e.  d 2 y

The blue line represents this slope function.
From the two graphs, the following can be observed:
 (i) From A to B on the curve, the slope is negative. 
For this  x -interval, the slope function (blue line) 
is also negative, i.e. the blue line is below the  
x -axis.
 (ii) From B to C on the curve, the slope is positive. 
For this  x -interval, the slope function (blue line) is also positive, i.e. the blue line

At the point B,  x  !  1. 
Notice that the slope function is also zero at the point where  x !  1.

Some of the features of these curves are:
>  In the function  y  !  f  ( x ), for  x   %   # 3, 
the slope is positive. 
This is represented in the slope function 
y  !  g  ( x ), where  g  ( x ) is positive for  x  %   # 3.
>  From A to B, the slope of the curve is negative. 
That is, from  x  $   # 3 and  x  %  2, the slope

It can be seen that the slope function is  
negative from  # 3  %   x  %  2.

At these two  x -values, the slope function is also zero.
>  For  x  $   2, the slope of the cubic function is positive. 
For  x  $  2, the slope function reﬂects this since it is also positive for  x  $  2.

Section 4.4   Maximum and minimum problems   
In section 4.2, it was shown that differential calculus can

be used in a very effective way to show that the maximum  
value of the given function is 10, and that this occurs  
when  x  !  2, as seen from the graph over.
In this section, we will show how differential calculus can  
also be used to maximise or minimise the value of any  
function, such as  € C  to represent cost, Area ( A ) to represent  
area, or  V  to represent volume.
The solutions of the more basic problems involving maxima and minima will consist  
of the following steps:

--- Page 118 ---

 1.  Draw a diagram, where necessary, and mark on it the given dimensions.
  2.  Write down an expression in one variable for the quantity to be maximised or minimised. 
If the quantity is in two variables, use the given information to express one of the 
variables in terms of the other so that the quantity may then be expressed in terms of  
one variable.
  3.  Differentiate the function and equate it to zero.
 4.  Solve this equation to ﬁnd the value(s) of  x  at which the maximum or minimum value 
occurs.
  5.  Substitute this value for  x  in the given equation to ﬁnd the maximum or minimum value.
 6.  Use the second derivative test   ( ! i.e.   d 2 y  
___  
d x 2   )  to determine if the value(s) for  x  gives a 
  maximum or minimum value of the function.

Section 4.5  Rates of change   
In our study of calculus so far, we have seen that   d y  
___  
d x   represents the rate of change of  y  with 
respect to  x .
Similarly, if  V  represents volume and  t  represents time, then   d V  
___  
d t    is the rate of change of 
volume with respect to time.
It is clear that the process of differentiation may be used to tackle many kinds of problems 
involving rates of change.
One of the more important applications of the rate of change concerns the movement of a 
particle which starts at a ﬁxed point O. 
The  displacement  is deﬁned as the change in position of the particle relative to O.
In this study of motion in a straight line, equations of the type  s   !  2 t 2   #  3 t  &   4   
occur frequently. 
In this equation,  s  represents the distance travelled (displacement) and  t  represents time.
The rate of change of  s  with respect to  t  (i.e. velocity) is given by   d s  
___  
d t   .
Velocity may be positive, negative or zero. 
If the velocity is positive, the particle is moving to the right. 
If the velocity is negative, the direction of the motion is to the left. 
A velocity of zero means the particle is instantaneously at rest.

--- Page 125 ---

The rate of change of velocity with respect to time is called the  acceleration ,  a , of the  
object in motion.
!    acceleration ( a )  !    d v  
___  
d t     or   d 2 s  
___  
d t 2   .
If  s  represents the distance travelled in time  t , then
 (i)   d s  
___  
d t    is the velocity of the object at any given time
 (ii)   d 2 s  
___  
d t 2   represents the acceleration of the object.
Speed and 
Acceleration
Note:   In the vast majority of the questions in the next exercise, ‘velocity’ and speed are 
interchangeable.
Note:  metres/sec 2  represents “metres per second per second”.

--- Page 126 ---

Note:   In general, the phrase “the rate of change of …” is taken to mean the rate of  
change with respect to  time . 
However, each question must be read carefully to identify the relevant  
variables and rates.

--- Page 127 ---


--- Page 128 ---

Section 4.6  Related rates of change   
In the previous section, we dealt with the use of the derivative as a measure of the rate of 
change of a function with respect to the variable.
If  A   !   ' r   2  represents the area of a circle of radius  r , then   d A  
___  
d r    is the rate of change of the 
area with respect to  r .
However, in practical cases, most rates of change are measured with respect to time.  
For example, if  V  represents volume,
  d V  
___  
d t    is the rate of change of volume with respect to time.
In many situations, we are given one rate of change and asked to ﬁnd another rate of change. 
In these situations, the  Chain Rule  is particularly useful when ﬁnding the required  
rate of change.
The Chain Rule states that   d y  
___  
d x   !   d y  
___  
d u   .  d u  
___  
d x   .
This can be extended to   d y  
___  
d x   !   d y  
___  
d • !   .  d •    
___  
d x   , where  •  stands for any variable.
For example,   d A  
___  
d r    !   d A  
___  
d t     .   d t  
___  
d r  

--- Page 129 ---

If we are given that   d A  
___  
d r    !  8, then  d r  
___  
d A   !   1 
__   8 .
Similarly, if   d V  
___  
d t    !  6 ' , then  d t  
___  
d V   !   1  
___  
6 '   .
The method of solving problems involving ‘related rates’ is illustrated in the  
following examples.
When solving problems with related rates of change, these steps should prove useful.
1.  Write down the rate you require, e.g.   d A  
___  
d t    .
2.  Write down the rate you are given, e.g.   d r  
___  
d t    .
3.  Use the Chain Rule to link these rates:   d A  
___

___  
?    .   ?  
__  
d t   !   d A

4.  Find an equation connecting the variables of the missing rate, i.e.  A   !   ' r   2 .
  d t

Geometric series are very important in the world of economics where we meet such terms as 
(i) Compound Interest (ii) Future Value (iii) Present Value (iv) Pensions (v) Annuity
(vi) Mortgage repayments (vii) Instalment savings, etc.
Section 5.1  Compound interest   
When the interest earned by a sum of money on  
deposit in a bank is not withdrawn, it is added to  
the  principal  for the second year.
The interest grows year by year and is said to   
be  compounded .
At a rate of 5% per annum, the increase in the  
interest earned by  € 10 000 can be seen year-on- 
year from the table.
If the interest is withdrawn and not reinvested each year, a total of 5  !   € 500  "   € 2500 is earned.
Compounding the interest, a total of  € 2763 is earned.
Generally, if  i  (per cent, expressed as a decimal) is the interest rate, then  i   !  P is the interest 
earned, where  € P is the principal or investment at the beginning of the year.
At the start of the second year, there is P  #   i P  "   P(1  #   i ) 1  on deposit in the bank.
The change in the principal, year-by-year, can be seen from the following table:
Year (end)

At the end of year  t , there is  € P(1  !   i ) t  on deposit.  
For example,  € 10 000, invested for 5 years at 5% compounded annually, amounts to  
€ 10 000 (1  #  0.05) 5   "   € 12,763.  !  the interest gained  "   € 2763.
APR  (“Annual Percentage Rate”) is the “true” annual rate of interest charged  
for borrowing money.  
AER  (“Annual Equivalent Rate”) is the rate of interest paid on  investments .
1. Final value
If the interest is ﬁxed for a period of time  t ,   then the principal  € P added to the compound 
interest is called the  ﬁnal value  of  € P.
The ﬁnal value of a sum of money   € P, invested now at  i % for  t  years, is 
Final value (F)  "   € P(1  !   i ) t
Interest earned  "   € P(1  !   i ) t   #   € P

--- Page 143 ---

It is now common practice to have interest “added monthly” to a savings account. 
In this case a monthly interest rate is applied that is equivalent to the annual rate.
If  r  is the monthly rate and  i   "  5% is the annual equivalent rate (AER), then for  
12 payments
(1  #   r ) 12   "  (1 #   i  )  "  (1  #  0.05)  "  1.05

!  5% per year is equivalent to 0.4074% per month.
Note:    i  is always expressed as a decimal, e.g. 5%  "  0.05
To calculate monthly interest rates,  r %:
(1  #   r ) 12   "  (1  #   i  )    r % per month ,  i % per year
2. Present value
To ﬁnd the present value of  € 10 000 due in three years time, we must calculate what  
sum of money, invested at  i %   (e.g. 5%  "  0.05) compounded annually, would have a  
ﬁnal value of   € 10 000.

Section 5.2  Depreciation   
In the previous section, money lodged into a savings account appreciated in value. 
The ﬁnal value was greater than the present value. 
Depreciation occurs when the ﬁnal value of an asset is less than the present value. 
Cars, computers and household appliances generally depreciate in value over time.
Houses in Ireland appreciated in value up to 2007 but have since greatly depreciated in value 
relative to this “peak” value. Two types of depreciation can be considered.
1.   Straight line depreciation  occurs when the value of an object reduces by a  
constant amount each year.  
For example, take a car costing  € 20 000 that loses 10% of its original value each year.  
This car loses  € 2000 in value each year and so the car has no value after 10 years.
2.   Reducing balance depreciation  occurs when the value of an object reduces by a ﬁxed 
percentage of its value each year.  
Consider   a car costing  € 20 000 that loses 10% of its value each year on a reducing balance.
The value of the car after 10 years  "   € 20 000 (1  $  0.1) 10   "   € 6973.57.

Section 5.3  Instalment savings (annuities)   
1. Instalment saving
If a constant amount of money is saved each month for 3 years in total, then each 
instalment earns different (compound) interest, since it is invested for a different length 
of time. The ﬁrst instalment is in the bank for 3 years  "  36 months ; the last instalment is 
in the bank for only one month.
Let  € P be invested at the beginning of each month for 3 years at a monthly rate of  i %. 
The ﬁrst payment has a value of P(1  #   i  ) 36  after 36 months.
The second payment has a value of P(1  #   i  ) 35  after 35 months, etc …
The total value of the investment is the sum of these 36 individual amounts.
This sum is calculated as follows:
P(1  #   i  ) 36   #  P(1  #   i  ) 35   #  P(1  #   i  ) 34   #  …… P(1  #   i  ) 2  #  P(1  #   i  ) 1 .

--- Page 150 ---

If we reverse the order, we get
P(1  #   i  ) 1  #  P(1  #   i  ) 2  #  P(1  #   i  ) 3  ……  #  P(1  #   i  ) 35   #  P(1  #   i  ) 36  
which is the sum of the geometric series where
the ﬁrst term,

my savings would be  € 89.13 at the end of the third year.

2. Pensions
Similar to instalment savings, we can calculate the sum of money needed to be invested 
now to guarantee a  ﬁxed pension  payable over a number of years.  
For example, if I want a pension of  € P per year for the next 20 years, I will need to 
calculate the present value of each of the payments,  € P, I will receive.  
The total of these “present value” amounts is the sum of money that needs to be invested. 
The sum of  € P, paid to you at the end of the ﬁrst year, has a present value now of   € P  
_______  
(1  #   i  )   .
The sum of  € P, paid at the end of the second year, has a present value now of  
€ P  
_______  
(1  #   i ) 2   .
The sum to be invested is obtained by summing all these amounts.
  € P

Note 1:   In answering questions on instalment savings and pensions it is best practice to set up 
the geometric series underpinning each question. 
It is important to identify the ﬁrst term, the common ratio and the number of terms 
in the series for each particular question.
Note 2:   It is also important to have a clear understanding of the time-line of series i.e when 
the ﬁrst/last payment is to be made/received.

ICT:  Using a graphics calculator or computer software, a comparison between 
instalment savings and the ﬁnal value (amount) of a sum of money left on deposit 
can easily be made.

Section 5.4  Loans – Mortgages   
If we wish to calculate the repayments needed for a car loan or a mortgage on a house,  
we use the same procedure for ﬁnding the present value as was used in the previous section. 
The sum of the present values of each repayment over the given period of time must be equal 
to the value of the car loan or mortgage.

3. Percentage Error / Tolerance / Degrees of accuracy
    (i) Percentage error
 
 During an experiment John  
estimated  the volume of a liquid to  
be 100 ml.
 
 He then measured it and found it  
to have a volume of 125 ml .
 
His percentage error is as shown.
  (ii) Tolerance
 
 If a measurement is taken against  
a scale e.g. (i) a ruler measuring  
length in mm (ii) a balance  
measuring mass(weight) in  g   
(iii) a clock measuring time in  s.
 
 the accuracy of that measurement  
is limited by the size of the smallest  
unit on the scale.
 
 The  tolerance  of that measurement  
is always  !   1   _  
2   (the basic unit on  
the scale)
 
 We say that the measurement is  
take  to within   ! 0.5 of the basic unit.
 
 If the measurement is the area or volume,  
each dimension will have a similar tolerance.
(iii) Degrees of accuracy
 
 When a measurement is calculated to a given degree of accuracy e.g. correct to 
1 place of decimals, an error on the measurement is created.
 
 E.g. If a length is calculated as 10.3 cm, corrected to 1 place of decimals, this  
implies a minimum possible length of 10.25 cm and a maximum possible length of 
10.34999….cm.

Section 6.4  Trapezoidal rule for calculating area  
To calculate the areas of shapes with irregular boundaries, e.g. ﬁelds, lakes, etc., surveyors 
have usually divided the area into a series of parallel strips, each in the shape of a trapezium; 
a quadrilateral with two of the four sides parallel to each other.

A straight line is drawn across the centre of the area, dividing it into a series of two  
different areas, A and B.
The area of each section, above and below the line, can be calculated separately using the 
formula for the area of a trapezium and then added together.
Along the line and at equal intervals of  h,  perpendicular

lines are drawn up to the boundary. These ordinates  
(offsets) –  y 1 ,  y 2 ,  y 3 , etc – are the parallel sides of the  
trapezium.
Using the area formula for a trapezium,   a   "   b

Note 1:   Because the top of each trapezium does not match the boundary at all points, the 
area obtained by this formula is only approximate.  
Its accuracy depends on the gap width  h  ; the smaller the gap width, the greater  
the accuracy.
Note 2:   If offsets are measured from the same points above and below the line, then  
the area (A  "  B) can be obtained using

In book 4, we dealt with permutations, combinations and the fundamentals of probability. In 
this chapter, we continue the study of probability and that will include more difﬁcult concepts 
such as expected value and independent events as well as an introduction to the normal 
distribution.
Section 7.1  Tree diagrams  
The possible outcomes of two or more events can be shown in a particular type of diagram 
called a  tree diagram . Each branch represents a possible outcome of one event. The 
probability of each outcome is written on the branch.
Consider this problem:
A fair coin is tossed three times.
Determine the probability that exactly 2 heads are obtained.
Here is the sample space of possible outcomes:
HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH and TTT
Since 2 heads appear on 3 occasions, 
P (2 heads)  !    3   _  
8  
The same possibilities can be represented  
in a more structured way on a tree diagram.
The branches that contain 2 heads are  
highlighted.

Section 7.2    Probability distributions – Expected value  
Probability distributions
Consider the following experiments
 (i) 4 coins are tossed:  x  is the number of heads obtained
 (ii) Three dice are thrown:  x  is the number of sixes obtained
 (iii) A hand of 7 cards is dealt:  x  is the number of kings
 (iv) 100 people are selected:  x  is the number of people of weight  #  150 kg
 (v) One person is selected at random:  x  cm is the height of that person
 (vi) One person is selected at random:  x  is the I.Q. of that person.
In each of the above experiments,  x  is called a  random variable  whose value depends, to 
some extent, on chance. In experiments (i) to (iv),  x  can take discrete values such as 0, 1, 2, 
3… and for that reason  x  is said to be a  discrete random variable . In experiments (v) and (vi), 
x  can take any value within a certain range and is said to be a  continuous random variable .  
In this section, we will consider only discrete random variables.
If a coin is tossed 3 times, the sample space of all possible outcomes is
TTT ,  TTH ,  THT ,  THH ,  HTT ,  HTH ,  HHT ,  HHH
If  x  is the number of heads obtained, a table of the results can be formulated as follows:
x
0
1

P ( x ) 
  1   _  
8  
  3   _

8  
This is called a  probability distribution , where  P ( x ) is the probability that  x  occurs.
Probability distributions are particularly useful when dealing with expected values, as shown 
below.

When the spinner is spun, it will land on 4, 8 or 12.
If the spinner is spun twice and we get 4 and 12, 
then the average of the two results is    4  "  12

  !  8.
If the spinner is spun 100 times, is there a quick way of  
ﬁnding the ‘average’ of these spins?
Yes and it is found by multiplying each outcome (4, 8 or 12) by the probability of that 
outcome occurring and then adding the results.
This average is called the  expected value .
This is set out in the table below:
Outcome ( x )

--- Page 201 ---

When each outcome is multiplied by its corresponding probability, we get 6, 2 and 1.
The sum of these results is 9.
The number 9 is the  expected value .
If the spinner above is spun a large number of times, the mean value of outcomes approaches 
the expected value, 9. Statisticians call this the  Law of large numbers .
Notice that the expected value 9 is not one of the possible  
outcomes, i.e., 4, 8 and 12.
The expected value of the outcome of an experiment is  
denoted by E(X).
When all the outcomes are multiplied by their corresponding probabilities and the results 
added, the operation can be expressed in a concise way as follows
E(X)  !   ∑ ( x ). P ( x ), where  ∑  represents ‘the sum of’.
The expected value is widely used in the insurance industry and in the operation of casino 
games. If you would like to know whether or not a casino game is fair, you would need to 
know what the payout is and the probability of getting that payout. In simple terms, you need 
to know the expected value of the payouts.
You also have to take into account the money you pay to play the game.
Let us consider this fun-park spinning-wheel on the right.  
It costs  € 8 to spin the wheel and you win the amount to 
which the arrow is pointing.
Is this a fair game?
First we calculate the expected value of the payout.
Payout ( x )
Probability ( P )
x   !   P
€ 10
  1   _

€ 5
€ 5

∑ x . P ( x )  !   € 5  "   € 1.25  "   € 1  !   € 7.25
The expected value of the payout is  € 7.25.
But it costs  € 8 to spin the wheel.
The ﬁnal (net) position is  € 7.25  $   € 8.00  !   $ € 0.75.
Thus if the wheel is spun a large number of times, you could expect to lose  € 0.75 on average 
on each spin.
When is a game fair?
To determine whether or not a game is  mathematically fair , we need to take into account
 (i) the expected value of the payout
 (ii) the cost of playing the game.
In general, the expected 
value need not be one of 
the possible outcomes.
  € 5
  € 4
  € 10

--- Page 202 ---

Then (a) if the (expected value  $  cost) is zero, the game is fair
 
(b) if the (expected value  $  cost) is greater than zero, you will win in the long-run
 
(c) if the (expected value  $  cost) is less than zero, you will lose in the long-run.
A game is  equitable  or  fair  if the player’s mathematical expectation is zero.

Section 7.3  Bernoulli trials – Binomial distribution  
The Swiss mathematician James Bernoulli(1654–1705) studied the probabilities occurring 
when several trials of the one experiment were carried out.
The characteristics of a Bernoulli trial are:
 1.  Each trial can have only two outcomes often referred to as  success  and  failure . 
 2.  The trials are independent (the outcome of one has no inﬂuence over the outcome of 
another trial)
 3.  The probability of  success  /  failure  remains constant from trial to trial.
 4.  There is a ﬁxed number of trials.
The probability of a success is generally called  p .
The probability of a failure is  q , where  p   "   q   !  1.
The three main applications of his study are as follows:
1. To ﬁnd the probability of a ﬁrst success after  n  trials
2. To ﬁnd the probability of  k  successes in  n  trials
A coin is biased in such a way that the probability of a head is always   2   _  
5   .
Consider tossing the coin four times. We would like to know the probability of getting three 
heads.

In book 4 we stated that    ( "   n  
      r   )   represents the number of ways of choosing  r  objects from  n  
different objects.
So the number of ways of selecting 3 heads from 4 (tosses of the) coins is    ( "   4  
      3  )  
Thus the probability of 3 heads and 1 tail =   ( "   4

The example above is a special type of probability model called the  binomial distribution .
In general, the probability of  r  successes in  n  trials is  
given by the general term of the binomial expansion of  
( p   "   q ) n , where  p  is the probability of success and  q  is  
the probability of failure.
Consider the event of obtaining a 6 from a single throw of an unbiased die.
P (success)  !    1   _  
6    and   P (failure)  !    5   _  
6  
If there are 4 such trials, then the probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 successes from 4 attempts is given 
by the terms of the expansion of   ( "   1   _

3. To ﬁnd the probability of  k th  success on the  n th  Bernoulli trial
In example 2 on the previous page, we worked out the probability of getting 3 sixes when 
a dice is thrown 5 times. If the same dice is thrown continuously until a six appears for the 
fourth time, how do we ﬁnd the probability that the 4th six appears on the tenth throw?
For a 4th six to appear on the 10th throw,
 (i) we need to get 3 sixes on the ﬁrst nine throws, and then
 (ii) get a six on the 10th throw.
Three sixes on the ﬁrst nine throws is given by
  ( "   9  
      3  )   p 3 q 9 $ 3   i.e.   ( "   9  
      3  )    ( "   1

P (six on the 10th throw)  !    1  
__   6 
Thus   P (4th six on the 10th throw)  !  0.13  %    1  
__   6  !  0.0217.

Section 7.4  How to show events are independent  
In book 4, it was stated that two events are  independent  when the outcome of one event does 
not affect the outcome of the other event.
We also used conditional probability to get a multiplication rule for independent events as 
follows:
P (A|B)  !    
P (A  "  B)  
_______  
P (B)       …  (conditional probability)
!   P (A  "  B)  !   P (A|B)  %   P (B)   …  (general multiplication rule)
In the case of independent events A and B, where the occurrence of one event has no effect 
on the other we conclude that;
P (A|B)  !   P (A)
!   P (A  "  B)  !   P (A)  %   P (B)
P (A  "  B)  !   P (A). P (B)
P (A and B)  !   P (A). P (B)
Multiplication rule for 
independent events:
In this section, we will use the multiplication rule to determine whether or not two events are 
independent. The following examples will illustrate the procedure.

--- Page 213 ---


--- Page 214 ---

Remember  :    1.  If two events are  independent ,
 
P (A  and  B)  !   P (A  "  B)  !   P (A). P (B)   …  ( P (A | B)  !   P (A)).
      2.  If two events are  mutually exclusive ,
 
P (A  or  B)  !   P (A  #  B)  !   P (A)  "   P (B)   …  ( P (A  "   B)  !  0).
Remember:
P (A|B)  !    P (A  "  B)  
_________  
P (B)

Section 7.5   Probability involving permutations and 
combinations  
Many of the more difﬁcult problems in probability involve the use of permutations or 
combinations to identify the number of possible outcomes or the number of favourable outcomes. 
While many problems can be solved in more than one way, the following worked examples will 
illustrate how combinations, in particular, can be used to solve certain types of problem.
Remember   ( "   n  
      r   )   !  the number of ways of selecting  r  objects from  n .
e.g. the number of ways of selecting 3 students from 6 is   ( "   6  
      3  )   !  20

--- Page 217 ---

Events occurring at least once
Many questions in probability contain phrases such as “at least once”, “at least one red disc”, etc.
Take, for example, the probability of getting at least one 4 when a pair of dice are thrown.
First get the probability that no 4 is thrown.
P (no 4)  !   P (no 4 on 1st throw)  %   P (no 4 on 2nd throw)  !    5   _  
6   %    5   _  
6   !    25  
__  
36  
 P (at least one 4)  !  1  $   P (no 4)  !  1  $    25  
__  
36   !    11  
__  
36  

--- Page 218 ---

Similarly, if a coin is tossed four times, the probability of getting at least two heads is 
P (at least 2 heads)  !  1  $   P (no head)  $   P (1 head)
In general, if  E  is any event, then
P ( E  occurring)  !  1  $   P ( E  not occurring)

Section 7.6  Probability simulations  
The word  simulate  means to imitate or model. The use of simulation is becoming an 
increasingly-powerful tool in the modern world of business. In the past, when an engineer 
was designing a new car or aeroplane, he would build a physical model ﬁrst and test its 
performance in wind tunnels. Now, initial tests are done on computers through the use of 
simulation programmes.
A  probability simulation  is the use of some method to model or represent a real experiment 
or situation.
Simulations can involve
>  dice, spinners, discs and counters
>  calculators and computers to generate random numbers
>  random number tables
You may also use experiments in simulation.

--- Page 220 ---

Think!
Can you propose an alternative way to ﬁnd how many packets you need to buy?
Perhaps your method might include the following:
>  generate a random number table 
>  use a spreadsheet
>  use a spinner
>  get your friends to buy some boxes to see how many you need to buy to get a full set.
The  advantages  of simulation are:
>  It is quick and inexpensive
>  When using a spreadsheet, you can get several hundred pieces of data
>  You can adjust the probability to cater for events that are not equally likely.

--- Page 221 ---

This example could also be modelled by
 (i) Rolling a dice with 1  $  3 indicates boy and 4  $  6 indicates girl
 (ii) Random numbers using a calculator or a table of random numbers:
0  $  4 indicates boy  and  5  $  9 indicates girl
 (iii) selecting from a deck of playing cards:
red indicates girl  and  black indicates boy

Note:    This answer seems surprisingly high but the true (calculated) probability is 42.7%.

Section 8.1  Introduction to functions   
In our study of maths so far, we have dealt with points such as (2, 4) and ( ! 3, 2) and learned 
how to plot these points on the coordinated plane.
Points such as (2, 4) and ( ! 3, 2) are examples of  ordered pairs .
An ordered pair, denoted by ( x ,  y ), is a pair of elements  x  and  y  in which  x  is considered to be 
the ﬁrst element and  y  is the second element.
A set of ordered pairs such as  A   "  {(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8)} is called a  relation .
Every relation determines two sets.
The set of all the ﬁrst elements of the ordered pairs is called the  domain .
The set of all the second elements of the ordered pairs is called the  range .
Some relations may be deﬁned by a  rule  relating elements in the domain to their 
corresponding elements in the range.
In order to deﬁne the relation fully, we need to specify both the rule and the domain.
For example,  { ( x ,  y ) ! y   "  2 x   #  1,  x   !  {1, 2, 3, 4} }  is the relation 
{(1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 7), (4, 9)}.
The domain is the set {1, 2, 3, 4} and the range is the set {3, 5, 7, 9}.
The relation above may be represented  
by a  mapping diagram , as shown.

Functions  
Functions are special relations with individual properties.
They are often referred to as “number machines”, with inputs and outputs.
When is a relation a function?
A  function  is a relation for which  each   x -value  in an input set, there is a  unique   y -value  of an 
output set.
When a function is represented by a mapping diagram, each element of the domain maps 
onto  one and only one  element of the range.
Consider these two mapping diagrams:
(i) 
a
d
b
e
c
f
 
(ii) 
1
1
2
! 2
4
Diagram (i) is not a function since the element  b  is paired with 2 different elements  
in the range.
Diagram (ii) is a function since each element in the domain is mapped onto  one and  
only one  element in the range.
Remember
Notation – domain – range  
Consider this rule for a function: “Square the input and add six.”
If we input  x , the output will be  x 2   #  6.
The rule for this function may be written  
in any of the three ways shown on the right.
When dealing with the domain and range of a function, it is important to know what the  
basic number systems are. These are given below:
N   "  {1, 2, 3, …}, the set of  natural  numbers,
Z   "  {…  ! 3,  ! 2,  ! 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …}, the set of  integers ,
Q   "  {fractions,   a  
__  
b   ,  a ,  b   !   Z ,  b   $  0}, the set of  rational  numbers,
R\Q   "  the set of  irrational  numbers, e.g.  % ,   √
__
 
2 ,  e , etc.
1. In the mapping of a function, only one arrow comes from 
each element of the domain.
2. Each element of the domain is operated on by the function.
 (i)  f  ( x )  "   x 2   #  6
 (ii)  f  :  x   →   x 2   #  6
 (iii)  y   "   x 2   #  6

--- Page 232 ---

When all these numbers are combined, we get the set of  real numbers,  R .
R "  is the set of  positive  real numbers.
Consider the function  f  :  N   →   N  :  x   →   x 2 .
This means that the set of input numbers comes from  N , the set of natural numbers.
The output numbers also come from the set  N .
The set of possible output numbers is called the  codomain .
However, the outputs generated by the function  f  :  N   →   N  :  x   →   x 2  are the square  
numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, …
The set of  actual outcomes  of a function is called the  range .
The range is always a subset of the codomain.
However, in some functions, the range and codomain may be the same set.
The function  f  :  N   →   N  :  x   →   x 2  is shown

Now consider the function  f  :  R   →   R  :  x   →   x 2   #  2.
The domain of  f  is the set of real numbers  R .
The codomain is also  R .
Domain intervals:  When we have an input, a function gives certainty about the output.  
To create functions from certain relations, it is necessary to restrict the domain and create 
intervals  in which the relation is a function.
1.  When dealing with the log function  f  :  R #   →   R  :  x   →  ln  x , the domain must be restricted to 
values of  x   &  0, that is,  x   !   R # .  
We cannot get the log of a negative number.
2.  For the function  f  ( x )  "    √
______  
4  !   x 2  , the domain must exclude the values  x   '   ! 2 or  x   &  2  
as these values for  x  result in the square root of a negative number which is not a  
real number.  
Thus, the domain is  ! 2  (   x   (  2.

Vertical line test for a function  
A very useful way to identify whether or not a relation is a function is to draw a graph of the 
relation and apply the  vertical line test . 
If a vertical line can be drawn anywhere on the graph, and it intersects the graph  more than 
once,  then the relation is  not  a function.

When describing intervals, the parentheses  
shown on the right are generally used.
1. { x   !   R   !   a   )   x   )   b }  "  [ a ,  b ]
2. { x   !   R   !   a   '   x   '   b }  "  ( a ,  b )

It is written as  g  ◦  f , or simply  gf .
g   ◦   f  is read ‘ g  after  f  ’.
The couples  g   ◦   f  from the diagram are 
{(1, 11), (3, 15), (5,19)}.
We will now consider two functions,  f  ( x )  "  2 x   #  5 and  g ( x )  "   x   !  3, to ﬁnd the rule for  
the composite function  gf  ( x ).
These functions are illustrated on the right.  
f
x
(2 x   !  5)
g
(2 x   !  5)
"  3
 
In  f , the output is (2 x   #  5) when the  
input is  x .
We will now use (2 x   #  5) as the input  
for the function  g .
Since  g ( x )  "   x   !  3, then  gf  ( x )  "   g (2 x   #  5)
 
  "  (2 x   #  5)  !  3 
… replacing  x  with (2 x   #  5)
 
gf  ( x )  "  2 x   #  2
We will now consider what happens when the order of the functions is changed.
fg ( x )   "   f  ( x   !  3)  
"  2( x   !  3)  #  5 
… replacing  x  with ( x   !  3)
fg ( x )  "  2 x   !  1
Since 2 x   #  2  $  2 x   !  1, this shows that  gf  ( x )  $   fg ( x ).
In general, if  f  and  g  are two 
functions, 
then  fg ( x )  $   gf  ( x )
i.e. the composition of functions 
(generally) is  not commutative

Note:   f   ◦   f  ( x ) is written as  f   2 ( x ).

Section 8.3  Types of functions   
In Section 8.1 of this chapter, a function was described as a relation where there is  
a  unique  output value for each input value.
In this section, we will discuss types of functions such as injective, surjective and  
bijective functions.
1. Injective functions
A function  f , from A to B, is said to be  injective  or 
1
A
B
3
5
7
7
5
8
9
11
 
one-to-one  if every output in B has a unique input in A. 
In a mapping diagram, no two inputs in A will have the  
same output in B; hence, the phrase ‘one-to-one’.
Note:    It is not necessary that every element in the  
codomain has a corresponding element in  
the domain.  
In the diagram on the right, 8 has no corresponding  
input; however, the mapping diagram still represents  
an injective function.

--- Page 243 ---

Examples
1   f  :  R   →   R  :  y   "   x   #  5.  
This function generates the couples such as (0, 5), (1,6), ( ! 2, 3), ( ! 7,  ! 2), …  
Each element in the domain has a unique corresponding element in the codomain.  
Hence,  f  is an injective function.
2  The function  f  ( x )  "   x 2  is  not  a one-to-one function as, for example,  f  ( ! 3)  "  9 and  
f  (3)  "  9; hence, 9 does not have a unique input.
Horizontal line test for injective functions
The diagram on the right shows the  
y
x
O
y   !   x 3  
graph of  y   "   x 3 .  
If  y   "   x 3  is an injective function, then  
any line drawn parallel to the  x -axis  
will intersect the curve  at most once .  
The diagram shows that  y   "   x 3  is an  
injective function.
2. Surjective (many-to-one) functions
A function  f  is  surjective  if  every  element of the codomain is the image of  at least   one  
element of the domain.
A surjective function may also be described  
f
a
A
f
B
b
c
d
e
g
h
i
 
as a mapping of A  onto  B. 
No element of the codomain is left unused.  
Hence, the range and the codomain are equal.
For any function  f , if the range and the codomain 
are equal, then the function is surjective.
Horizontal line test for surjective functions
Consider the function  f  :  R   →   R .  
y
x
O
y   !   x 3  
If  f  is surjective, then every horizontal line  
drawn must intersect the graph  at least once . 
The function  y   "   x 3 , where  x   !   R , is  
surjective as every horizontal line intersects  
the graph at least once.

--- Page 244 ---

3. Bijective functions
A function  f  is  bijective  if for every element  y  in B, 
A
B
1
1
2
4
3
9

16
 
there is exactly one element  x  in A such that  f  ( x )  "   y .
Therefore, a bijective function is both injective  
and surjective.
From the diagram, it can be seen that there is an  
exact one-to-one match between the elements in A and B.  
This function is bijective.

Section 8.4  Inverse functions   
In previous sections, we have seen that a function generates a set of  y -values, called the 
range, from a set of  x -values, called the domain.
In this section, we will deal with the reverse of this procedure  
by ﬁnding the elements of the domain when given the  
elements of the range.
In the given mapping diagram, the couples  
f
f   ! 1
1
4
3
7
5
10
7
13
 
of  f  are:
f   "  (1, 4), (3, 7), (5, 10), (7, 13)

--- Page 249 ---

If we reverse these couples, we get a new function called  f   # 1 . 
f   ! 1  is said to be the  inverse function  of  f .
From the mapping diagram,  f   ! 1   "  (4, 1), (7, 3), (10, 5), (13, 7).
For every couple ( a ,  b ) that  f  creates,  f   ! 1  will  
x
y
O
f   ! 1 ( x )
( y ,  x )
f ( x )
y  "  x
( b ,  a )
( a ,  b )
( x ,  y )
 
create the couple ( b ,  a ).
Thus,  f  and  f   ! 1  create points that are reﬂections  
of one another in the line  y   "   x .
Note:   As can be seen from the diagram, a function  f   
has an inverse if and only if it is bijective,  
i.e. the function must be  one to one  and  onto .  
Take the function  f  ( x )  "   x 2 .  
(2, 4) and ( ! 2, 4) are couples of  f . 
So the couples (4, 2) and (4,  ! 2) are couples of  f   ! 1 .  
This shows that  f   ! 1  is not a function as the input 4  
does not have a  unique  output.  
Since  f  ( x )  "   x 2  is not bijective, it does not have an inverse.
How to ﬁnd the inverse of a function  
Let 
f  ( x )  "  3 x   !  2
 
⇒   y   "  3 x   !  2
 
3 x   "   y   #  2
 
x   "    y   #  2  
_____  
3   
… express  x  in terms of  y
  !   f   ! 1 ( x )  "    x   #  2  
_____  
3   
… replace  y  with  x
 
f   ! 1 ( x )  "    x   #  2  
_____  
3   is the inverse function of  f  ( x ).
We can verify that the inverse function is correct by showing that  f  (3)  "  7 and  f   ! 1 (7)  "  3.

--- Page 250 ---

In Example 1 above, it was shown that  f   ! 1 f  ( x )  "   x .
It can also be shown that  f f   ! 1 ( x )  "   x .
Restricted domain  
Consider the two graphs shown below:
x
O
(2, 4)
( ! 2, 4)
f ( x )
f ( x )  "   x 2 ,  x   !   R
f
     
x
O
h ( x )
h
h ( x )  !   x 2 ,  x   "  0
f  ( x )  "   x 2 ,  x   !   R  is a function but it is not injective (therefore not bijective) as a horizontal 
line will intersect the graph more than once. Since it is not bijective, it has no inverse.
h ( x )  "   x 2 ,  x   *  0 is a function in the restricted domain  x   *  0.
h ( x ) is a bijective function and hence has an inverse.
The inverse function  h ! 1 ( x ) is  y   "    √
__
 
x  , for  x   *  0.
If  f  and  f   ! 1  are inverse functions, the domain of  f  is the range of  f   ! 1 .
For any two functions 
f  and  f   ! 1 , then
 (i)  f f   ! 1 ( x )  "   x .
 (ii)  f   ! 1 f  ( x )  "   x .

Section 8.5  Sketching the graphs of functions   
In our study of algebra so far, we will have learned how to construct a table of ordered pairs, 
then plot these points and draw the graph of the function.
In this section, we will show how to draw a rough sketch of a graph by concentrating on the 
shape of the graph, as well as the main features of the graph.
The important features of any graph include
>  the general shape of the graph, e.g. the graph of a quadratic function
>  the point(s) where the graph crosses the  x -axis and the  y -axis
>  the turning points of a quadratic and cubic graph.
1. Linear functions
The graph of a line such as  y   "  2 x   !  4 can be         
y
x
O
(2, 0)
y   !  2 x   "  4
(0,  " 4)
 
drawn by ﬁnding the points where the line intersects  
the  x -axis and  y -axis.  
When  x   "  0,  y   "  2(0)  !  4, i.e.  y   "   ! 4.  
When  y   "  0, 2 x   !  4  "  0, i.e.  x   "  2.
!   (0,  ! 4) and (2, 0) are points on the line.
2. Quadratic functions
The general form of a  quadratic function  is  f  ( x )  "   ax 2   #   bx   #   c , where  a ,  b  and  c  are 
constants and  a   $  0.
When  a   &  0, the graph of  f  ( x ) 
When  a   '  0, the graph of  f  ( x )  
looks like this: 
looks like this:
 
The lowest point of the curve  
The highest point of the curve  
is called the  minimum point . 
is called the  maximum point .

--- Page 254 ---

To draw a rough sketch of a quadratic function, we require
 (i) the points where the graph intersects the  x -axis and  y -axis
 (ii) the turning point of the curve.
The turning point can be found by either of these methods:
 (i) expressing the function in  completed square  form, or 
 (ii) using calculus. (chapter 4)
Here is an example of how to express a quadratic function in ‘completed square’ form.
x 2   !  8 x   #  9
"   x 2   !  8 x   #  16  !  16  #  9 
… add and subtract (half the coefﬁcient of  x ) 2
"  ( x   !  4) 2   !  7
The turning point is (4,  ! 7).
The axis of symmetry is  x   "  4.
Note:  In the example above if  f  ( x )  "   ! x 2   #  4 x   #  5 then  f  + ( x )  "   ! 2 x   #  4
!  turning point occurs at  f  + ( x )  "  0  "   ! 2 x   #  4
!   x   "  2 and  f  (2)  "   ! 2 2   #  4(2)  #  5  "  9  !  (2, 9) is the turning point.
For the function
y   "   k ( x   !   p ) 2   #   q ,
>  the turning point is (  p ,  q )
>  the minimum value is  q .

--- Page 255 ---

3. Cubic functions
A cubic function generally takes the form
f  ( x )  "   ax 3   #   bx 2   #   cx   #   d , where  a ,  b ,  c  and  d   !   R .
The graph of a cubic function  f  ( x )  "   ax 3   #   bx 2   #   cx   #   d , generally consists of a smooth 
curve with two turning points as follows:
a   !  0
a   "  0
OR
When  a   &  0, the graph begins 
When  a   '  0, the graph begins  
by rising from left to right. 
by falling from left to right.
We can sketch a graph of a cubic function by ﬁnding the points where the curve 
intersects the axes. The accuracy of the sketch can be improved by locating the local 
maximum and minimum turning points if required.

4. Finding equations for given cubic graphs
The graph of a function is shown on the right.

It intersects the  x -axis at  x   "   ! 2, 0 and 2.
This function will contain  x ( x   #  2)( x   !  2) as part  
of the expression.
Notice that the graph also contains the point (1, 1).
To accommodate this condition, the equation of the  
function will take the form  y   "   kx ( x   #  2)( x   !  2),  
where  k  is a number to be found.
We use the fact that (1, 1) is on the graph to ﬁnd the  
value of  k .
(1, 1)  !  of the graph: 
y   "   kx ( x   #  2)( x   !  2) 
 
⇒  1  "   k (1)(3)( ! 1) 
 
⇒   ! 3 k   "  1   ⇒   k   "   !   1   _  
3  
!  The equation of the function is  y   "   !   1   _  
3   x ( x   #  2)( x   !  2)
 
i.e.  y   "   !   x  
__   3 ( x   #  2)( x   !  2)
 
or  y   "   !   1   _  
3   x 3   #    4   _  
3   x

--- Page 258 ---

Note:   If a graph touches (but does not cross) 
the  x -axis at a point, a double root 
occurs at this point. This point can  
either be a local maximum or minimum 
turning point. 
As in the graph over  f  ( x )  "  ( x   !  4) 2  
⇒  roots at, 0  "  ( x   !  4)( x   !  4) 
⇒  a double root at  x   "  4. 
We also note that  f   + ( x )  "  2 x   !  8 
⇒   f   + ( x )  "  0 at  x   "  4 i.e. a turning point at  x   "  4.

Section 8.6  Exponential and logarithmic functions   
Any function of the form  f  ( x )  "   a x , where the base  a  is a positive real number other than 1, 
is called an  exponential function  (or index function).
y   "  2 x  and  y   "  10 x  are examples of exponential functions.
The function  f  ( x )  "   e x  is a special exponential function where  e  is the real number 2.718, 
correct to three decimal places.
The graph of an exponential function has a very recognizable shape. 
Two types of graphs will be examined.
1. Graphs of  y   $   a x ,  a   &  1

--- Page 263 ---

The graph above shows that as  x  decreases in value, the curve approaches the  x -axis but 
never touches it. The  x -axis is said to be an  asymptote  to the curve.
The graph intersects the  y -axis at (0, 1). 
The range of the function is  R # , i.e. the  
range is  y   &  0.
Graphs of  y   "  2 x ,  y   "  3 x  and  y   "  4 x  are drawn  
on the same diagram, as shown.
The larger the value of  x , the steeper the rise  
in the curve.
Each curve crosses the  y -axis at (0, 1).
2. Graphs of  y   $   a x , 0  '   a   '  1
In the graph shown on the previous page, the  y -values decrease as the  x -values increase.
The graph contains the point (0, 1).
The range of the function is  R # .
The graph of  y   "  2 ! x  is a reﬂection in the  y -axis of the graph of  y   "  2 # x .

It is similar to the graph of  y   " 2 x , but each  y -value  
is multiplied by 3.

In general, the graph of  y   "   k  . 2 x  intersects the  
y -axis at (0,  k ).

 The graph of  y   "  log 10   x  is the  
reﬂection in the line  y   "   x  of the

The diagram on the right above illustrates that the inverse of the exponential function  y   "  e x   
is the  logarithmic function   y   "  log e   x .
log e   x  is generally written as ln  x .

Section 8.7  Related graphs   
In previous sections of this chapter, we dealt with a variety of functions as well as the graphs 
of these functions.
In this section, we will examine how changes to the equation of a function affect the graph of 
the function. We will conﬁne our discussion to four basic changes.

are shown.
Multiplying a function by a constant  
will not change the points where the  
graph intersects the  x -axis but it does  
have the effect of stretching the  
graph up and down.

Section 9.1  Scatter diagrams   
A  scatter graph  or  scatter diagram  is a graph consisting of points plotted on an  x – y  plane. 
Each point represents the values of two different variables such as the heights and weights of 
different individuals. Such data connecting two variables is called  bivariate data .
After plotting the points on a scatter graph, we look for a pattern, particularly a  linear  
pattern. If the points on a scatter graph lie approximately on a straight line, we say that there 
is a linear relationship between the two sets of data. The closer the points are to a straight 
line, the stronger the relationship will be.
The table below shows the average temperature and the number of ice-creams sold by a shop 
over a 12-day period.

The scatter graph shows that the number of ice-creams sold increases as the temperature 
increases. Since the points lie close to a straight line, we say that there is a linear relationship 
between the two sets of data.

Correlation
Correlation  is the strength of a relationship between two variables, say  x  and  y . We say  x  and  y  are 
correlated if a scatter graph shows a linear pattern to the plotted points ( x ,  y ). If no pattern 
exists, the variables are not correlated.
The three diagrams below illustrate  positive correlation ,  negative correlation  and  no correlation .
The variables  x  and  y  have a

The correlation is  high  if the points are close to a straight line.
The correlation is  low  if the points are more spread out.
It is possible to have strong and weak positive correlations as well as strong and weak 
negative correlations.

Causal relationships and correlation
The price of a used car depends, among other things, on the age of the car. The age of the car 
causes  the price of the car to decrease. We say that there is a  causal relationship  between the 
age of the car and the price of the car.
Deﬁnition   
When a change in one variable causes a change in another 
variable, we say that there is a causal relationship between them.
The scatter graph shows the relationship

between the sales of iced drinks and  
temperature. The correlation is strong  
and positive. You would expect this as  
a rise in temperature would tend to  
result in an increase in the sales of  
iced drinks.

--- Page 285 ---

It would therefore be reasonable to conclude that there is a  causal relationship  between the 
increase in temperature and the sales of ice creams.
The scatter diagram below shows the number of iPads and the number of fridges sold by an 
electrical shop over a ten-month period.

The graph shows that there is a reasonably strong positive correlation between the number of 
iPads sold and the number of fridges sold. However,  
this does not mean that there is a causal relationship  
between them; buying an iPad does not cause you to  
buy a fridge.
Correlation does not 
necessarily mean that there 
is a causal relationship.

Section 9.2  Measuring correlation – Line of best ﬁt   
1. Calculating the correlation coeﬃcient
Correlation  is the strength of a relationship between two sets of data.
The numerical measure of this property is called the  correlation coefﬁcient  and is denoted by 
the letter  r .
The value of  r  will always lie between  ! 1 and 1.
 r   "  0 indicates no correlation.
 r   "  1 indicates  perfect positive  linear correlation.
r   "   ! 1 indicates  perfect negative  linear correlation.
Here are some examples of the value of  r :
r   !  1
Perfect positive
correlation
r   !   " 1
Perfect negative
correlation
r   !  0.5
Some positive
correlation
r   !  0
No correlation
r   !   " 0.8
Strong negative
correlation
The nearer the value of  r  is to 1 or  ! 1, the closer the points on the scatter diagram are to a 
straight line.
There are several methods of calculating a correlation coefﬁcient.
The method selected for our course is called the  product–moment correlation coefﬁcient,  r . 
The formula that is used to ﬁnd this coefﬁcient involves a lot of tedious calculations.
For our course, it is recommended that we use the electronic calculator to ﬁnd the value of  r .
The steps involved in the input of data and ﬁnding the value of  r  are given in  Appendix 1  at 
the end of the book.
2. The line of best ﬁt
We have already stated that when points on a scatter diagram lie on, or close to, a straight 
line a strong correlation exists.
To draw the line that ﬁts best through the points you should aim to have the points evenly 
spread on either side of the line.
This scatter diagram shows the average

A line that is drawn to pass as  
close as possible to all the plotted  
points on a scatter diagram is 
called the  line of best ﬁt .

--- Page 289 ---

The line drawn is called  the line of best ﬁt .
It can go through some, all or none of the points.
This line shows the general trend of the relationship between the two sets of data. The line 
can be used to estimate other values. However, estimating values where the line has been 
extended beyond the existing points is less reliable.

--- Page 290 ---

3. Finding the equation of the line of best ﬁt
From our knowledge of coordinate geometry, we should be familiar with the equation of a 
line in the form  y   "   mx   #   c .
In statistics it is more usual to use the form (in the calculator),  y   "  A  #  B x
The equation,  y   "  A  #  B x  has a gradient (slope) of B and its intercept on the  y  axis is (0, A)
Thus to ﬁnd the equation of a line of best ﬁt drawn by eye,
 (i) ﬁnd two points on the line and use these points to ﬁnd the slope of the line.
 (ii) Use the slope found and one of the points to ﬁnd the equation of the line using
y   !   y 1   "   m ( x   !   x 1 ).
 (iii) Express the equation in the form  y   "  A  #  B x .

Section 9.3  The normal distribution   
When the physical characteristics, such as height or weight, of a large number of individuals 
are arranged in order, from lowest to highest, in a frequency distribution, the same pattern 
shows up repeatedly. This pattern shows that large numbers cluster near the middle of the 
distribution, as illustrated by the symmetrical histogram shown below.
If the distribution is very large and continuous, and the class intervals become sufﬁciently 
small, the distribution forms a symmetrical bell-shaped smooth curve called   the curve of 
normal distribution  or simply the  normal curve  as shown on the following page:
The normal curve
The normal distribution is the most important continuous distribution in statistics.
The curve on the right shows a normal distribution  
with mean  $ . 
The red line is the axis of symmetry.
The mode, median and mean are all equal.
They lie on the axis of symmetry.
All normal distributions will have a mean ( $ ) and standard deviation ( % ).
Different values for  $  and  %  will give different normal distributions.

This rule is highlighted below.
The Empirical

one standard deviation of the mean
•  95% lie within two standard deviations of the mean
•  99.7% lie within three standard deviations of the mean.

--- Page 297 ---


--- Page 298 ---

Note:   The Empirical Rule gives a rough approximation of percentages of data lying within 
a number of standard deviations of the mean. A far more accurate method, involving 
z -tables, will be seen in the next section.
Standard scores ( z -scores)
In a state examination, Karen got 72% in her English examination and 68% in her Maths 
examination. In which examination did she achieve the better result? To determine this, we 
would need to know the average mark and standard deviation for each subject. We would 
then need to ﬁnd the number of standard deviations Karen’s mark was above or below the 
mean in each subject. If her mark was 1 standard deviation above the mean in English and 
0.75 standard deviations above the mean in Maths, then Karen would have done relatively 
better in her English examination.
The number of standard deviations  
that a value lies above or below the mean  
is called a  standard score  or  z -score .
In general, if  x  is a measurement belonging to a set of data with mean  $  and standard 
deviation  % , then its value in  z -units is given below:
 
x   is the score or value
z   "    x   !   $

Section 9.4  Normal Probability Distributions 
A probability distribution is similar to  
a frequency distribution, and also has a mean  
and a standard deviation.
For a continuous random variable,  X ,  
the probability that  X  lies between  a  and  b ,  
i.e.  P ( a   &   X   &   b ), is given by the area under  
the curve between  a  and  b .
From the theory of probability the area under  
the entire curve is always 1.
A probability distribution can be normally distributed, just like a frequency distribution. 
A probability distribution that has the distinctive bell shape is called a  normal probability 
distribution .
Standard Normal Distribution ( Z  Distribution)
There are many different normal probability distributions, with different means and different 
standard deviations.
The most important normal probability distribution, for many reasons, is the so-called 
standard normal probability distribution. This has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. 
It is also called the  Z  distribution.
The area between the standard normal curve and the  Z -axis is 1.

P ( Z  !   1.2)

Pages (36–37) of  formulae and tables  gives the area under the curve as far as a particular 
value of  Z .
The shaded area in the diagram above represents the probability that  Z   &  1.2.
However, since the curve is symmetrical about the line  Z   "  0, the tables allow us to ﬁnd the 
area under the curve for any value of  Z .

P ( a   z   X   z   b )

The method of ﬁnding various areas under the curve are shown below:
P ( Z   &   1.68 ) can be read directly from the tables. 
P ( Z   &  1.68)  "  0.9535
P ( Z   '   0.85 )

To ﬁnd the area to the right of 0.85 
use the equation,
P ( Z   '  0.85)  "  1  !   P ( Z   &  0.85)
 
"  1  !  0.8023
 
"  0.1977
P ( Z   &   ! 1.23 )

! 1.23
Z
To ﬁnd the area left of  ! 1.23, we use 
the fact that the curve is symmetrical 
and ﬁnd the area to the right of 1.23
i.e. 
P ( Z   &   ! 1.23)  "  1  !   P ( Z   &  1.23)
 
"  1  !  0.8907
 
"  0.1093
P ( ! 1.21   &   Z   &   0.93 )

0.93
! 1.21
Z
To ﬁnd this area 
 (i) ﬁnd area to the left of 0.93
 (ii) ﬁnd area to the left of  ! 1.21.
Then subtract (ii) from (i)
For example,  
Area to the left of 0.93  "  0.8238
Area to the left of  ! 1.21  "  1  !   P ( Z   &  1.21)
 
"  1  !  0.8869  "  0.1131
⇒  area of shaded portion  "  0.8238  !  0.1131
 
 
"  0.7107
If we are given the probability that  Z   &   k , we can still use the tables to ﬁnd the value of  
Z  that corresponds to  k .

--- Page 305 ---

The following example illustrates this.
Other Normal Distributions
Suppose a random variable  X  which is normally distributed has a mean of  µ  and a standard 
deviation of  % . The standard normal tables ( Z  tables) can be used to ﬁnd probabilities 
connected with  X .
This is done by converting values of  X  into the corresponding  Z  values. The formula for 
converting from the given ( x  – units) into  z  – units is given below.
Standard scores   
 
>   x  is the given score or variable
z   "    x   !   $  
______  
%    
>   $  is the given mean
 
>   %  is the given standard deviation
Thus for example to calculate  P ( X  &  x 1 ):
 (i) calculate  z 1   "    x 1   !   µ  
______  
%  
 , for a given  x 1 ,  µ  and  % .
 (ii) then  P ( X  &  x 1 )  "   P ( Z  &  z 1 )

Section 10.1   Conﬁdence interval for population 
proportion   
1. Margin of error and conﬁdence intervals
When dealing with sampling in  Statistics 1 , it was stated that the purpose of sampling is to 
gain information about the whole population by surveying a small part of the population.  
If data from a sample is collected in a proper way, then the sample survey can give an 
accurate indication of the population characteristic that is being studied.
Before a general election, a national newspaper generally requests a market research 
company to survey a sample of the electorate regarding their voting intentions in the election. 
The number surveyed is generally about 1000.
The result of the survey might appear in the daily newspaper as follows:
40% support for  The Democratic Right .
The  40%  support is called the  sample proportion , that is, the part or portion of the sample 
who indicated that they would vote for  The Democratic Right .
A sample proportion is used to give an estimate of the  population proportion  who intend to 
vote for  The Democratic Right .
The notation  p ˆ   is used to denote  sample proportion .
The notation  p  is used to represent  population proportion .
Since  p  is generally not known,  p ˆ  is used as an  estimator  for the true population proportion,  p .
Of course everybody knows that sample surveys are not always 100% accurate. There is 
generally some ‘element of chance’ or  error  involved.
The newspaper might add to their headline the following sentence:
The margin of error is 3%.
Ke words
sampling distribution   Central Limit Theorem   parameter   statistic    
standard error   conﬁdence interval   proportion   hypothesis    
null hypothesis   critical region   test statistic    p -value
Inferential statistics

--- Page 316 ---

The  margin of error  of 3% is a way of saying that the result of the survey is 40%  !   3% .  
That means that the research company is quite ‘conﬁdent’ that the proportion of the whole 
electorate who intend to vote for  The Democratic Right  could be anywhere between 37% 
and 43%.
The expressions for the  margin of error ,  E , depend on how conﬁdent we want to be of where 
the population proportion lies. In the work that follows, we examine the margin of error at 
the 95% conﬁdence level, i.e. the interval in which 95% of the samples will lie.
The result of the opinion poll above was given as 40%  !  3%. 
That could be written as 37%  "   p   "  43%, where  p  is the population proportion.
37%  "   p   "  43%  is called the  conﬁdence interval .
The ‘conﬁdence’ level is pitched at 95%.
The 95% conﬁdence implies that the interval was obtained by a method which ‘works 95% of 
the time’.
The conﬁdence interval, 37%  "   p   "  43%, is a way of stating that if you surveyed many 
samples of 1000 people on the same day, the results would be in the interval 37% to 43% in 
95% of the samples.
In general, if  p ˆ  is a sample proportion for a population proportion,  p , then the conﬁdence 
interval for  p  is given by 
p ˆ  #   E   "   p   "   p ˆ  $   E ,
where  E  is the margin of error.
2. Conﬁdence interval using the margin of error approximation
At the 95% conﬁdence level, the margin of error,  E , can be found by using the margin of 
error approximation:
E   %    1  
__  
  √
__
 
n    , where  n  is the size of the sample.
For example, if the sample size is 1000, 
then  E  %    1  
____  
  √
_____
 
1000    !  0.03  !  3%.
If the sample size( n ) is increased, the margin of error,  E , is reduced.
Using this expression for the margin 
of error,  E , the 95% conﬁdence  
interval for  p , the population proportion, 
is given over.
Note:   The margin of error approximation,  E   %    1  
__  
  √
__
 
n    , only applies at the 95% level of 
conﬁdence. Since it can be quite inaccurate, it should only be used if requested to do so.

Note:   In calculations,  p ,  p ˆ  and  E  are always expressed in decimal form.
 
 E.g. if 150 television viewers are interviewed in a sample survey and 63 say they like a  
new talk show, then the sample proportion is  p ˆ   %    63  
___  
150   %  0.42.

--- Page 318 ---

3. Margin of error using the standard normal tables
If many samples of the same size are taken from a population, each sample will produce a 
different (but similar) proportion. All these proportions form their own distribution called 
the  sampling distribution of the proportion .
The  standard error ,  " p , of this  
distribution is given on page 34  
of  Formulae and Tables  and is  
shown on the right.
Since  p , the population proportion, is generally not known,  
p ˆ  , the sample proportion, is used as an  estimator  for the population proportion.
In this section we will use the Standard Normal Tables   ( " rather than the margin of error,   1  
___  
  √
__
 
n    )  
to get a more accurate conﬁdence interval for a population proportion.
Since the 95% level of conﬁdence will be  
used, the diagram on the right will remind  
us that 95% of a normal distribution lies  
within 1.96 standard deviations of the  
mean.

Section 10.2   Hypothesis testing for population 
proportion   
A  hypothesis  is a statement or conjecture made about some statistic or characteristic of  
a population.
Here is an example of a hypothesis:
‘A football team is most likely to concede a goal just after it has scored a goal’.
A  hypothesis test  is a statistical method of proving the truth or otherwise of the statement  
or claim.
A local council reduced the speed limit on a dangerous 8 km stretch of country road from 
80 km/hr to 60 km/hr. The number of accidents on the stretch was reduced from 5 per month 
to 3 per month. The council claimed that the speed reduction was effective. Is the council 
correct in its claim?
In cases like this, a hypothesis test is set up to prove or disprove the claim.
Procedure for carrying out a hypothesis test on a population proportion
The procedure for carrying out a hypothesis test will involve the following steps:
1.  Write down  H 0 , the  null hypothesis , and  H 1 , the  alternative hypothesis
For example, to test if a coin is biased if we get 7 heads in 10 tosses, we could formulate 
the following hypothesis:
H 0  : The coin is not biased.
H 1  : The coin is biased.
2.  Write down or calculate the sample proportion,  p ˆ .
3.  Find the margin of error,  E
From Section 10.1, we note that there are two methods for calculating the margin of error:
 
  (i)  E   %    1  
___  
  √
__
 
n   
 
 (ii)  E   %   1.96  √
________
 
  p (1  #   p )  
________  
n  
 
Unless you are asked to use method (i), the margin of error approximation, you should 
use the more accurate second version.

4.  Write down the conﬁdence interval for  p , using
p ˆ   !   E  "   p   "   p ˆ   #   E
5.   (i)  If the value of the population proportion stated is within the conﬁdence interval,  do  
not reject  the null hypothesis H 0 .
 
 (ii)  If the value of the population proportion stated is outside the conﬁdence interval, 
reject  the null hypothesis H 0  and accept H 1  (the alternative hypothesis).
Le v el of 
signiﬁcance
If the population proportion,  p , does not lie in the 95% conﬁdence 
interval, it is said to be signiﬁcant at the  5% level of signiﬁcance .

Section 10.3   Sampling distribution of the mean –  
The central limit theorem   
The sampling distribution of the mean  
If we are interested in the weights, for example, of all sixteen-year-olds in Ireland, we 
generally require the mean and standard deviations of these weights. We use the symbols
 (i)  (  to denote the  population mean
 (ii)  &  to denote the  population standard deviation .
In such a large population it would be impossible to obtain the weight of each person and 
so the values of  (  and  &  will not be known. However, if we take a random sample of this 
population, we can get approximate values for  (  and  & . Obviously, the larger the sample, the 
more accurate we would expect the approximations to be.
If we take a large number of different 
random samples of size  n , each 
sample will have its own mean,   _   x  , and 
standard deviation,  s . 
Some of these samples are illustrated 
on the right.
The different means of these samples 
are called the  sample means .
If a large number of samples of the same  
size are taken, you get a correspondingly large number of means.
These means form their own distribution giving us the  distribution of sample means .
This distribution is also called  the sampling distribution of the mean .
The following example illustrates the shape a distribution of sample means might take when 
different samples (of the same size) from a population are selected.

x 1
Sample 2
x 2
Sample 3
x 3
Sample 4
x 4
Sample 5

Sample 6

--- Page 327 ---

If you examine the distribution of the sample means plotted on the right in the worked 
example above, you will notice that it begins to approximate to a normal distribution.  
In this case the sample size was only 2.
However, as the sample size  n  increases the closer the distribution will approximate to a 
normal distribution. Also the mean of the sampling distribution will be the same as the mean 
of the population.
The successive diagrams below illustrate the  shape  of the  sampling distribution of means  
resulting from different-sized samples from a given population with a normal distribution.

--- Page 328 ---

From the diagrams, you can see that if samples are taken from a normal population, the 
sampling distribution of means is normal for any sample size.
As  n  increases, the curve representing the sampling distribution of the mean gets taller and 
narrower. These diagrams also show how the standard deviation decreases as  n  increases.  
The sample means will be packed tightly around the population mean. The larger the samples 
become, the tighter the means will be packed.
From the worked example and from the three diagrams shown above, we can see that when 
samples are taken from a population, the sampling distribution of the mean takes on the 
characteristics of a normal curve as the sample size increases. This observation leads us to 
one of the most important theorems in statistics that is widely used in sampling. It is called 
the  Central Limit Theorem  and is stated more formally below.
The  
Central  
Limit  
Theorem
The diagram on the right illustrates  
how the distribution of the sample  
mean approximates to a normal  
distribution even when the  
underlying population is skewed.
When dealing with the sampling  
distribution of the mean, we convert  
the given units to standard units  
using the formula given on the right.

will approximate to a normal distribution regardless of what the population

Section 10.4   Conﬁdence interval for a population  
mean   
In Section 10.3, the Central Limit Theorem was used to show that the sampling distribution 
of the mean approximates to a normal distribution for large  n  ( n   )  30). In this section we 
introduce a different way of presenting information provided by a sample mean to estimate 
the mean of the population from which the sample came.
If samples of size  n  are taken from a population, the means of the samples will vary.  
To accommodate this variety, we introduce (as before for proportions) the concept of a 
conﬁdence interval  for the mean.  
The endpoints of this interval are called  conﬁdence limits .  
The  degree of conﬁdence  is generally given as a percentage.
These percentages are generally 90%, 95% and 99%.
Note:   As the conﬁdence level increases 90%–95%–99% the  conﬁdence interval widens .
In the standard normal distribution, we require the values of  z 1  such that 95% of the 
population lies in the interval  # z 1   '   Z   '   z 1 .
The work involved in ﬁnding the value of  z 1 , is shown below.  
We use the standard normal tables on pages 36 and 37 of  Formulae and Tables .
From the given diagram,
P( Z   '   z 1 )   %  0.95  $  0.025 
%  0.975
From the tables
z 1   %  1.96
⇒   # z 1   %   # 1.96
0
! z 1
! 1.96

--- Page 335 ---

Thus in the normal distribution, 95% of the population lies within 1.96 standard deviations of the 
mean.
If  (  is the population mean, then 95% of the sample means lie in the interval
  _   x  #  1.96 &   _  
x   "   (   "     _  x  $  1.96 &   _

Section 10.5   Hypothesis testing for a population  
mean   
Hypothesis testing
In Sections 10.1 and 10.4 we dealt with conﬁdence intervals, one of the two most common 
types of statistical inference.  
As we have seen in Section 10.2 the second type of statistical inference is  hypothesis testing . 
The procedure for performing a hypothesis test on a population mean ( µ ) is similar to the 
procedure for performing a hypothesis test on a population proportion ( p ) (Section 10.2).
It has already been shown that in any normal distribution 95% of the population lies within 
1.96 standard deviations of the mean, that is, 95% of the population will be in the interval  
(   !  1.96 & .
If we are dealing with a normal distribution and an experiment produces a result which is 
outside the interval  (   !  1.96 & , we would be inclined to suspect that factors other than chance 
are involved in the result. 
To test the result we start with the assumption, or hypothesis, that the result is not biased.
This assumption is called the  null hypothesis , denoted by  H 0 .
Usually the null hypothesis is a statement of “ no  difference”, “ no  effect” or “ no  change”.
An hypothesis test is then carried out to  reject  or  not reject  the null hypothesis.
In this test, we speak of rejecting the null hypothesis ‘at a certain level’.
This ‘certain level’ is called the  level of signiﬁcance .
The 5% level of signiﬁcance creates a 95% conﬁdence interval.
The 5% level of signiﬁcance means that the result obtained is likely to occur on only 5 
occasions out of 100.

--- Page 340 ---

At the 5% level of signiﬁcance, the set of values,  z   *  1.96 or  z   "   # 1.96, is known as the 
critical region  and the boundaries of the critical region are called the  critical values .
If the values of  z  are in the critical region (i.e.  z   *  1.96 or  z   "   # 1.96), we reject the null 
hypothesis and conclude that factors other than chance are involved.
The critical regions at the 5% level of signiﬁcance are shown below.

Hypothesis testing for a population mean
When a population is very large, it is generally not practical to ﬁnd the true mean and 
standard deviation of the total population. However, assumptions are often made about these 
values and their validity is tested based on observations made from random samples taken 
from the population.
Take, for example, machines designed to produce batteries which last for 120 hours with a 
standard deviation 4 hours. What conclusions can we come to about one of these machines if 
a random sample of 50 batteries produced by it had a mean life of 121 hours?
We now begin the process of investigating whether these machines are producing the type of 
battery they were designed to produce. This process is called hypothesis testing.
Here are the basic steps of a hypothesis test:
1.  Write down  H 0 , the  null hypothesis , and  H 1 , the  alternative hypothesis .
H 0 : The mean life of a battery is 120 hours.
H 1 : The mean life of a battery is  not  120 hours.
2.  State the  signiﬁcance level ,  # .
The signiﬁcance level on our course is 5% ( +   %  0.05).
This means that if  z   "   # 1.96 or  z   *  1.96, we  reject  the null hypothesis and  accept  the 
alternative hypothesis.
3.  Calculate the value of the  test statistic .  
This involves converting the given units to  z -units.
At the 5% level of signiﬁcance, the null hypothesis is rejected if
z   "   # 1.96  or   z   *  1.96

--- Page 341 ---

To convert the given units to standard units we use
  
  _   x  %  the sample mean

0.566   %  1.767
The test statistic is  z   %  1.767.
4.  Come to a  conclusion .  
Since  z   %  1.767 does not lie outside the range  # 1.96  "   z   "  1.96 it is  not  in the  critical region .
So we do  not reject  the null hypothesis and states that the mean life of a battery is  
120 hours.
Note:   If  & , the standard deviation of the population is not given, use  s  the standard deviation 
of the sample instead.

--- Page 342 ---

Using  p -values
Suppose we carry out an hypothesis test and ﬁnd the test statistic to be  z   %  2.16.
Since 2.16 is greater than 1.96, we reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level of signiﬁcance  
( +   %  0.05).
Instead of comparing  z   %  2.16 with  z   %  1.96 (and  z   %   # 1.96), we could compare the total 
area of the two coloured regions below with the speciﬁc level of signiﬁcance,  +   %  0.05.
We use pages 36 and 37 of  Formulae  
and Tables  to ﬁnd the probability  
that  z   '   # 2.16 or  z   )  2.16.
P( Z   '   # 2.16)  $  P( Z   )  2.16)
%  2P( Z   )  2.16)
%  2[1  #  P( Z   '  2.16)]
%  2[1  #  0.9846]
%  2[0.0154]
%  0.0308
The shaded areas above are referred to as the  p -value , or probability-value corresponding to 
the observed value of the test statistic.
The value 0.0308 found above is the  p -value that corresponds to the test statistic  z   %  2.16.
The  p -value 0.0308 is interpreted as the  lowest level of signiﬁcance  at which the null 
hypothesis could have been rejected.
With a test statistic of  z   %  2.16 ( p -value  %  0.0308), we would certainly have rejected the null 
hypothesis at the speciﬁed level of signiﬁcance ( +   %  0.05).
The  p -value of 0.0308 gives us a  speciﬁc  or more precise level of signiﬁcance.
The  smaller  the  p -value is, the  stronger  is the evidence against H 0  provided by the data.

Steps involved in a test of signiﬁcance using a  p -value
1.  Write down the  null hypothesis H 0  and the  alternative hypothesis H 1 .
2.  State the  signiﬁcance level  + . (On our course  +   %  0.05.)
3.  Calculate the  test statistic .
4.  Find the  p -value that corresponds to the test statistic.
5.  If the  p -value  *  0.05, the result is not signiﬁcant and we do  not  reject the null hypothesis H 0 .
If the  p -value  ' 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis H 0  in favour of the alternative hypothesis H 1 .
