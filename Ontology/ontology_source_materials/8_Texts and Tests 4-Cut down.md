## Preface

This substantially revised book is the first of two volumes that amalgamate the previous editions of Text \& Tests 4, 5, 6 and 7 into two books for the Higher Level Leaving Certificate Project Maths course. Text \& Tests 4 encompasses more than 55\% of the course.

As a Fifth-Year book, it introduces students to all five strands of the course and fully reflects the overall approach to the teaching of Maths as stated in the learning outcomes for Project Maths. It encourages the development of not only the students' knowledge and skills but also the understanding necessary to apply these skills.

The extensive range of imaginatively written and probing questions on each topic will help students understand the concepts involved and develop their problem-solving skills. Every attempt has been made to grade the questions in order of difficulty.

At the beginning of each chapter, there is a list of Key Words that students are expected to know and understand when the chapter is completed.

Each chapter concludes with a three-part revision exercise section consisting of (a) Core, (b) Advanced, and (c) Extended Response questions.

The Higher Level course will be completed by the new edition of Text \& Tests 5.

## Section 1.1 Polynomial expressions

Polynomial expressions are formed from the addition of many algebraic terms with positive integer powers.

$$
5 x^{3}-3 x^{2}+4 x-6 \text { is a polynomial expression. }
$$

This expression consists of four terms; $5 x^{3},-3 x^{2}, 4 x$ and -6 .

A binomial expression contains two terms.

A trinomial expression contains three terms.

The degree of a polynomial is given by the highest power of $x$.
(a) $4 x-6$ is a linear polynomial since the highest power (degree) of $x$ is 1 .
(b) $-3 x^{2}+4 x-6$ is a quadratic polynomial of degree 2 .
(c) $5 x^{3}-3 x^{2}+4 x-6$ is a cubic polynomial of degree 3 .

Each polynomial is written in order of (i) decreasing powers of $x$, e.g. $5 x^{3}-3 x^{2}+4 x-6$, or (ii) increasing powers of $x$, e.g. $9+3 x-4 x^{2}$.

The coefficient of $x^{3}$ is the number before $x^{3}$ in the expression.
In $4 x^{3}-2 x^{2}+5 x-6$, the coefficient of $x^{3}$ is 4 , the coefficient of $x^{2}$ is -2 , the coefficient of $x$ is 5 , and -6 is the constant term.

## 1. Addition and subtraction of polynomial expressions

Each term in a polynomial represents a different quantity, e.g. $8,6 x, 4 x^{2}$.
When simplifying an expression, all like terms should be combined into a single term.

## Example 1

Expand and simplify each of the following expressions.
(i) $7\left(x^{3}+2 x^{2}-5 x\right)-2\left(2+3 x+4 x^{2}-2 x^{3}\right)$
(ii) $3 x^{2}\left(4 x^{2}-5 x+6\right)+4 x\left(8 x^{3}-2 x-3\right)$
(i) $7\left(x^{3}+2 x^{2}-5 x\right)-2\left(2+3 x+4 x^{2}-2 x^{3}\right)=7 x^{3}+14 x^{2}-35 x-4-6 x-8 x^{2}+4 x^{3}$

$$
=11 x^{3}+6 x^{2}-41 x-4
$$

(ii) $3 x^{2}\left(4 x^{2}-5 x+6\right)+4 x\left(8 x^{3}-2 x-3\right)=12 x^{4}-15 x^{3}+18 x^{2}+32 x^{4}-8 x^{2}-12 x$

$$
=44 x^{4}-15 x^{3}+10 x^{2}-12 x
$$

## 2. Multiplying polynomial expressions

To multiply algebraic expressions, we use the distributive law, i.e. $a(b+c)=a b+a c$.

## Example 2

Simplify the following: $(x-5)\left(2 x^{2}-3 x+6\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
(x-5)\left(2 x^{2}-3 x+6\right) & =x\left(2 x^{2}-3 x+6\right)-5\left(2 x^{2}-3 x+6\right) \\
& =2 x^{3}-3 x^{2}+6 x-10 x^{2}+15 x-30 \\
& =2 x^{3}-13 x^{2}+21 x-30
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: Multiplying polynomial expressions is often called expanding.

## 3. Perfect squares

Any polynomial of the form $(x+a)^{2}$ is called a perfect square.

$$
\begin{aligned}
(x+a)^{2} & =(x+a)(x+a) \\
& =(x)(x+a)+(a)(x+a) \\
& =x^{2}+a x+a x+a^{2} \\
& =x^{2}+2 a x+a^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& (x+a)^{2}=x^{2}+2 a x+a^{2} \\
& (x-a)^{2}=x^{2}-2 a x+a^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, $(x-a)^{2}=x^{2}-2 a x+a^{2}$.
For example, $(2 x-3)^{2}=(2 x)^{2}-2(2 x)(3)+(3)^{2}=4 x^{2}-12 x+9$

## Example 3

Given that $25 x^{2}+p x+16$ is a perfect square and $p>0$, find the value of $p$.
Since $25 x^{2}=(5 x)^{2}$ and $16=(4)^{2}, \quad \therefore 25 x^{2}+p x+16=(5 x+4)^{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad 2(5 x)(4) & =p x \\
\therefore \quad 40 x & =p x \quad \Rightarrow p=40 .
\end{aligned}
$$

(Note: $16=(-4)^{2} \quad \therefore \quad 2(5 x)(-4)=p x \quad \Rightarrow p=-40$, which is not valid because $p>0$ )

## 4. Expanding $(x-a)(x+a)$

The expansion of $(x-a)(x+a)=x^{2}+a x-a x-a^{2}$

$$
=x^{2}-a^{2}
$$

$$
(x-a)(x+a)=x^{2}-a^{2}
$$

Similarly, $(a-5 b)(a+5 b)=a^{2}-5 a b+5 a b-(5 b)^{2}=a^{2}-(5 b)^{2}$

$$
=a^{2}-25 b^{2}
$$

This expansion results in a binomial expression called the difference of two squares.
This result is important when we need to factorise an expression of the form $a^{2}-b^{2}$ as we will see later on in the chapter.

## 5. Dividing algebraic expressions

Algebraic quotients take many different forms. Some may be simplified as in the following cases.

Case 1. The denominator is a factor of each term of the numerator.
(i) $\frac{6 x^{3}-8 x^{2} y+4 x y^{2}+2 x^{2}}{2 x}=\frac{6 x^{3}}{2 x}-\frac{8 x^{2} y}{2 x}+\frac{4 x y^{2}}{2 x}+\frac{2 x^{2}}{2 x}=3 x^{2}-4 x y+2 y^{2}+x$

Case 2. The denominator is one of the factors of the numerator.
(ii) $\frac{6 x^{2}+5 x y+y^{2}}{(2 x+y)}=\frac{(3 x+y)(2 x+y)}{(2 x+y)}=3 x+y$

Case 3. The denominator divides into the numerator using long division.
(iii) $\frac{2 x^{3}-9 x^{2}+10 x-3}{(x-3)}=2 x^{2}-3 x+1$ using long division.

## Long Division

$$
\begin{array}{rll} 
& 2 x^{2}-3 x+1 & \\
x-3 & \stackrel{2 x^{3}-9 x^{2}+10 x-3}{ } & \ldots \text { divide } 2 x^{3} \text { by } x \text { to get } 2 x^{2} \\
\frac{2 x^{3}-6 x^{2} \quad(\text { subtract })}{-3 x^{2}+10 x-3} & \ldots \text { multiply } 2 x^{2} \text { by denominator } \\
& \frac{-3 x^{2}+9 x \quad \text { (subtract) }}{x-3} & \ldots \text { divide }-3 x^{2} \text { by } x \text { to get }-3 x \\
\underline{x-3 \quad \text { (subtract) }} & & \ldots \text { diviple } x \text { by } x \text { to get } 1
\end{array}
$$

Hence, $\quad \frac{2 x^{3}-9 x^{2}+10 x-3}{(x-3)}=2 x^{2}-3 x+1$.

## Example 4

Divide $\left(2 x^{3}-11 x+6\right)$ by $\left(2 x^{2}+4 x-3\right)$.
Since this cubic polynomial has no power of $x^{2}$, it is good practice to rewrite the polynomial leaving space for the $x^{2}$ coefficients as follows;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \begin{aligned}
2 x ^ { 2 } + 4 x - 3 \longdiv { 2 x ^ { 3 } - 1 1 x + 6 } & \ldots \text { divide } 2 x^{2} \text { into } 2 x^{3} \text { to get } x \\
\frac{2 x^{3}+4 x^{2}-3 x}{-4 x^{2}-8 x+6} & \ldots \text { multiply } x \text { by } 2 x^{2}+4 x-3 \text { and then subtract } \\
\underline{-4 x^{2}-8 x+6} & \ldots \text { divide } 2 x^{2} \text { into }-4 x^{2} \text { to get }-2 \\
\therefore\left(2 x^{3}-11 x+6\right) \div\left(2 x^{2}+4 x-3\right) & =x-2
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note also that when we divide $2 x^{3}-11 x+6$ by $x-2$ we get $2 x^{2}+4 x-3$.

The factors of the polynomial $2 x^{3}-11 x+6$ are ( $x-2$ ) and ( $2 x^{2}+4 x-3$ ),

$$
\text { i.e. } \quad 2 x^{3}-11 x+6=(x-2)\left(2 x^{2}+4 x-3\right)
$$

We will use this property more fully in the chapter on factorisation.

$$
\begin{array}{r}
x-2 \frac{2 x^{2}+4 x-3}{2 x^{3}-11 x+6} \\
\frac{2 x^{3}-4 x^{2}}{4 x^{2}}-11 x+6 \\
\frac{4 x^{2}-8 x}{-3 x}+6 \\
-3 x+6
\end{array}
$$

## Section 1.2 Polynomial functions, an introduction

Polynomial functions arise as we try to solve day-to-day problems.

Let $x \mathrm{~cm}$ be the length of a rectangle.
If the width of the rectangle is 5 cm shorter than the length, then $(x-5) \mathrm{cm}$ is the width.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-010.jpg?height=187&width=421&top_left_y=1524&top_left_x=1211)

The area, $A$, of the rectangle depends on the length and width and by extension depends on $x$.

The symbol for the area depending on $x$ is written as $\boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol{x})$.
Therefore, $A(x)=x(x-5)=x^{2}-5 x$. As $x$ varies, the area $A$ varies.
$x$ is called the independent variable and $A(x)$ the dependent variable.
$A(x)$ is the quadratic polynomial $x^{2}-5 x$ of degree 2 .
We note that if $x=10 \mathrm{~cm}$, then $A(10)=(10)^{2}-5(10)=50 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.
We also note that the width is $(x-5) \Rightarrow x-5>0$

$$
\Rightarrow x>5 \mathrm{~cm}
$$

## Example 1

The length of a rectangle is $(2 x+3) \mathrm{cm}$. If the area of the rectangle is given by the polynomial function $A(x)=2 x^{2}+7 x+6$, find
(a) an expression for the width of the rectangle
(b) an expression for the perimeter, $P(x)$, of the rectangle
(c) the minimum value of $x$.

Let $w$ be the width of the rectangle.
(a) Area $A(x)=2 x^{2}+7 x+6=w(2 x+3)$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-011.jpg?height=168&width=385&top_left_y=510&top_left_x=1156)
$\therefore \quad w=\frac{2 x^{2}+7 x+6}{(2 x+3)}=\frac{(2 x+3)(x+2)}{(2 x+3)}=(x+2)$.
(b) The perimeter $P(x)=2(2 x+3)+2(x+2)=4 x+6+2 x+4=6 x+10$.
(c) Since $(2 x+3)$ is the length of the rectangle,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow(2 x+3)>0 \\
& \Rightarrow x>-1.5
\end{aligned}
$$

Note 1: $A(x)$ must be understood as a single concept and does not imply that $A$ is multiplied by $x$.
It simply tells us that the quantity $A$ depends on a variable $x$.
Note 2: Polynomial functions can be added and subtracted as before by collecting like terms and simplifying.

## Example 2

Given $f(x)=3 x^{3}-4 x^{2}-3 x+4$ and $g(x)=5 x^{3}+14 x^{2}+7 x-2$, find
(a) $2 f(x)-g(x)$ and state its degree
(b) $f(x)+2 g(x)$ and state its degree.
(a) $2 f(x)-g(x)=2\left(3 x^{3}-4 x^{2}-3 x+4\right)-\left(5 x^{3}+14 x^{2}+7 x-2\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =6 x^{3}-8 x^{2}-6 x+8-5 x^{3}-14 x^{2}-7 x+2 \\
& =x^{3}-22 x^{2}-13 x+10 \text { which is of degree } 3
\end{aligned}
$$

(b) $f(x)+2 g(x)=\left(3 x^{3}-4 x^{2}-3 x+4\right)+2\left(5 x^{3}+14 x^{2}+7 x-2\right)$

$$
=3 x^{3}-4 x^{2}-3 x+4+10 x^{3}+28 x^{2}+14 x-4
$$

$=13 x^{3}+24 x^{2}+11 x$ which is of degree 3 .

## Evaluating polynomial functions

The value of a polynomial function is obtained by substituting a given value for the independent variable and simplifying.
If $p(x)=2 x^{2}-5 x+6$, then $p(1)=2(1)^{2}-5(1)+6=3$
and $p(-3)=2(-3)^{2}-5(-3)+6=39$.

A new variable can also be introduced in a similar way.
Given that $p(x)=2 x^{2}-5 x+6$,

$$
p(t)=2 t^{2}-5 t+6
$$

Note: Polynomial functions with more than one independent variable occur regularly.
The volume of a cylinder $V=\pi \cdot r^{2} \cdot h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ the height of the cylinder.
In function terms: $V(r, h)=\pi \cdot r^{2} \cdot h$,
that is, the volume of the cylinder depends on both the radius, $r$, and the height, $h$.
The volume $V$ depends on two independent variables, $r, h$.
The degree of this polynomial is 2, the highest power (index) of either variable.

## Section 1.3 Factorising algebraic expressions

An algebraic factor divides evenly into a polynomial leaving no remainder.
$(x-3)$ is a factor of $2 x^{3}-9 x^{2}+10 x-3$
because $\left(2 x^{3}-9 x^{2}+10 x-3\right) \div(x-3)=\left(2 x^{2}-3 x+1\right)$.
$(x-4)$ and $(x+3)$ are both factors of $x^{2}-x-12$ because
(i) $\left(x^{2}-x-12\right) \div(x-4)=(x+3)$ and also
(ii) $\left(x^{2}-x-12\right) \div(x+3)=(x-4)$.

To solve algebraic equations, we first need to be able to factorise different algebraic expressions.

Several different techniques can be used for factorising expressions and these are shown below.

## 1. Finding the highest common factor by inspection

(i) $3 x^{2}-9 x y=3 x(x-3 y) \Rightarrow$ the factors are $3 x$ and $(x-3 y)$
(ii) $2 a^{2} b-4 a b^{2}+12 a b c=2 a b(a-2 b+6 c) \Rightarrow$ the factors are $2 a b$ and $(a-2 a b+6 c)$.

## 2. Grouping terms

$$
\begin{aligned}
6 x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-12 x-6 y & =3 x y(2 x+y)-6(2 x+y) \\
& =(2 x+y)(3 x y-6) \\
& \Rightarrow \text { the factors are }(2 x+y) \text { and }(3 x y-6)
\end{aligned}
$$

## 3. Difference of two squares

Since $(x+y)(x-y)=x^{2}-y^{2}$, the factors of $x^{2}-y^{2}$ are $(x+y)$ and $(x-y)$.
Note: When simplifying quotients, it is important to be able to factorise fully expressions containing the difference of two squares.
(i) $c^{2}-d^{2}=(c-d)(c+d)$
(ii) $x^{2}-9 y^{2}=x^{2}-(3 y)^{2}=(x-3 y)(x+3 y)$
(iii) $x^{2}-8 y^{2}=x^{2}-(\sqrt{8} y)^{2}=(x-\sqrt{8} y)(x+\sqrt{8} y)$
(iv) $x-9=(\sqrt{x})^{2}-3^{2}=(\sqrt{x}-3)(\sqrt{x}+3)$

## Example 1

Factorise fully
(i) $x^{4}-y^{4}$
(ii) $12 x^{2}-75 y^{2}$
(i)

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^{4}-y^{4} & =\left(x^{2}\right)^{2}-\left(y^{2}\right)^{2} & \ldots \text { write as the difference of two squares } \\
& =\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\right)\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) & \ldots \text { another difference of two squares occurs } \\
& =(x-y)(x+y)\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) &
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $12 x^{2}-75 y^{2}=3\left(4 x^{2}-25 y^{2}\right) \quad \ldots$ find the highest common factor by inspection

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =3\left[(2 x)^{2}-(5 y)^{2}\right] \quad \ldots \text { write as the difference of two squares } \\
& =3(2 x-5 y)(2 x+5 y)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

Simplify $\frac{x^{2}-9 y^{2}}{3 x+9 y}$

$$
\frac{x^{2}-9 y^{2}}{3 x+9 y}=\frac{(x-3 y)(x+3 y)}{3(x+3 y)}=\frac{x-3 y}{3}
$$

## 4. Factorising quadratic expressions

We can factorise quadratic expressions of the form $a x^{2}+b x+c$ using either
(i) trial and error or
(ii) when the coefficients are large or irrational, the quadratic formula.
(i) $x^{2}+3 x-18=(x \pm ?)(x \pm ?) \ldots$ checking all the factor pairs of -18 $=(x+6)(x-3) \ldots( \pm 1, \pm 18),( \pm 2, \pm 9),( \pm 3, \pm 6) \ldots(+6,-3)$ is the factor pair which, when added, produces +3 for the middle term.
(ii) $3 x^{2}-17 x+20=a x^{2}+b x+c \rightarrow a=3, b=-17, c=20$.

Using $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$,

If $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$, then $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$
$x=\frac{17 \pm \sqrt{(-17)^{2}-4.3 .20}}{2.3}=\frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289-240}}{6}$
$\Rightarrow x=\frac{17 \pm 7}{6}=\left(\frac{24}{6}\right.$ or $\left.\frac{10}{6}\right)=\left(4\right.$ or $\left.\frac{5}{3}\right)$
If $x=4$, then $(x-4)$ is the factor.
And if $x=\frac{5}{3} \Rightarrow 3 x=5$, therefore the second factor is $(3 x-5)$.
$\therefore \quad 3 x^{2}-17 x+20=(3 x-5)(x-4)$.

## Example 3

Factorise
(i) $3 x^{2}+10 x+8$
(ii) $x^{2}-2 \sqrt{2} x-6$
(i)

$$
\begin{aligned}
3 x^{2}+10 x+8 & =(3 x \pm ?)(x \pm ?) \ldots \text { the factor pairs of } 8 \text { are }( \pm 1, \pm 8),( \pm 2, \pm 4) \\
& =(3 x+4)(x+2) \ldots \text { producing a middle term of }+10 x
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $x^{2}-2 \sqrt{2} x-6=a x^{2}+b x+c \rightarrow a=1, b=-2 \sqrt{2}, c=-6$

$$
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \rightarrow x=\frac{2 \sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{(-2 \sqrt{2})^{2}-4(1)(-6)}}{2.1}=\frac{2 \sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}
$$

Therefore, $x=\frac{2 \sqrt{2} \pm 4 \sqrt{2}}{2}=\sqrt{2} \pm 2 \sqrt{2}=3 \sqrt{2}$ or $(-\sqrt{2})$.
The factors are $(x+\sqrt{2})$ and $(x-3 \sqrt{2})$.

## 5. Factorising expressions of the form $x^{3}-y^{3}$ and $x^{3}+y^{3}$

We can show by long division that $(x-y)$ is a factor of $x^{3}-y^{3}$, creating a second factor $x^{2}+x y+y^{2}$.

Therefore, we can write

$$
x^{3}-y^{3}=(x-y)\left(x^{2}+x y+y^{2}\right)
$$

Similarly, we have that

$$
x^{3}+y^{3}=(x+y)\left(x^{2}-x y+y^{2}\right)
$$

If we can write a polynomial in one of these

$$
\begin{aligned}
x-y & x^{2}+x y+y^{2} \\
& \frac{x^{3}}{x^{3}-x^{2} y}-y^{3} \\
& +x^{2} y \\
& +x^{2} y-x y^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$ forms, we can use these factor pairs as templates to find its factors.

For example, we can write
(i) $27 x^{3}+y^{3}=(3 x)^{3}+y^{3}$
(ii) $64 x^{3}-125 y^{3}=(4 x)^{3}-(5 y)^{3}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x^{3}-y^{3}=(x-y)\left(x^{2}+x y+y^{2}\right) \\
& x^{3}+y^{3}=(x+y)\left(x^{2}-x y+y^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Also

$$
\begin{aligned}
& (a x)^{3}-(b y)^{3}=(a x-b y)\left(a^{2} x^{2}+a b x y+b^{2} y^{2}\right) \\
& (a x)^{3}+(b y)^{3}=(a x+b y)\left(a^{2} x^{2}-a b x y+b^{2} y^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 4

Factorise (i) $a^{3}+8 b^{3} \quad$ (ii) $64 c^{3}-125 d^{3}$
(i) $a^{3}+8 b^{3}=a^{3}+(2 b)^{3} \ldots$ note: let $x=a$ and $y=2 b$ in the box on previous page

$$
=(a+2 b)\left(a^{2}-2 a b+4 b^{2}\right)
$$

(ii) $64 c^{3}-125 d^{3}=(4 c)^{3}-(5 d)^{3} \ldots$ note: let $x=4 c$ and $y=5 d$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =(4 c-5 d)\left[(4 c)^{2}+(4 c)(5 d)+(5 d)^{2}\right] \\
& =(4 c-5 d)\left(16 c^{2}+20 c d+25 d^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 1.4 Simplifying algebraic fractions

Algebraic fractions are added, subtracted, multiplied and divided in the same way as numerical fractions.

## Revision:

(i) $\frac{2}{5}+\frac{3}{7}=\frac{14}{35}+\frac{15}{35}=\frac{29}{35}$
(fractions can only be added or subtracted when they have the same denominator.)
(ii) $\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{3}{7}=\frac{6}{35}$
(fractions are multiplied by multiplying the numerators and denominators separately.)
(iii) $\frac{2}{5} \div \frac{3}{7}=\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{7}{3}=\frac{14}{15}$
(fractions are divided by changing the division into a product.)

Note:

$$
\frac{{ }^{2} G \times 12}{1^{3}}=24 \quad \frac{{ }^{2} G+12^{4}}{1^{3}}=6
$$

Similarly with algebraic terms;
(i) $\frac{2}{x+1}-\frac{2 x}{2 x+3}=\frac{2(2 x+3)}{(x+1)(2 x+3)}-\frac{2 x(x+1)}{(x+1)(2 x+3)} \ldots$ getting a common denominator

$$
=\frac{4 x+6-2 x^{2}-2 x}{(x+1)(2 x+3)}=\frac{-2 x^{2}+2 x+6}{(x+1)(2 x+3)} \ldots \text { simplifying the numerator }
$$

(ii) $\frac{2}{x+1} \times \frac{2 x}{2 x+3}=\frac{4 x}{(x+1)(2 x+3)} \ldots$ multiplying numerators and multiplying denominators
(iii) $\frac{2}{x+1} \div \frac{2 x}{2 x+3}=\frac{2}{x+1} \times \frac{2 x+3}{2 x}=\frac{2(2 x+3)}{2 x(x+1)}=\frac{(2 x+3)}{x(x+1)} \ldots$ changing division to multiplication and then dividing above and below by a common factor

So, in general when dealing with algebraic fractions;
(i) A common denominator is needed to add or subtract fractions.
(ii) A fraction can be reduced (simplified) only if the numerator and denominator have a common factor.
(iii) If the denominator or numerator contain fractions added or subtracted, they must be reduced into a single fraction first before proceeding.
(iv) To divide fractions, we multiply by the denominator inverted.

## Example 1

Simplify
(i) $\frac{5 a x}{15 a+10 a^{2}}$
(ii) $\frac{t^{2}+3 t-4}{t^{2}-16}$
(iii) $\frac{\frac{5}{8}+y}{\frac{1}{8}}$
(i) $\frac{5 a x}{15 a+10 a^{2}}=\frac{(5 a) x}{(5 a)(3+2 a)}=\frac{x}{3+2 a}$
(ii) $\frac{t^{2}+3 t-4}{t^{2}-16}=\frac{(t+4)(t-1)}{(t-4)(t+4)}=\frac{t-1}{t-4}$
(iii) $\frac{\frac{5}{8}+y}{\frac{1}{8}}=\left(\frac{5}{8}+y\right) \cdot 8=5+8 y$

## Example 2

Simplify each of the following
(i) $\frac{6 y}{x(x+4 y)}-\frac{3}{2 x}$
(ii) $\frac{x-4}{x^{2}-x-2}-\frac{x-3}{x^{2}-4}$
(i) $\frac{6 y}{x(x+4 y)}-\frac{3}{2 x}=\frac{2(6 y)}{2 x(x+4 y)}-\frac{3(x+4 y)}{2 x(x+4 y)}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{2(6 y)-3(x+4 y)}{2 x(x+4 y)}=\frac{12 y-3 x-12 y}{2 x(x+4 y)} \\
& =\frac{-3 x}{2 x(x+4 y)}=\frac{-3}{2(x+4 y)}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $\frac{x-4}{x^{2}-x-2}-\frac{x-3}{x^{2}-4}=\frac{x-4}{(x-2)(x+1)}-\frac{x-3}{(x-2)(x+2)}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{(x-4)(x+2)-(x-3)(x+1)}{(x-2)(x+1)(x+2)} \\
& =\frac{x^{2}-4 x+2 x-8-x^{2}+3 x-x+3}{(x-2)(x+1)(x+2)} \\
& =\frac{-5}{(x-2)(x+1)(x+2)}=\frac{-5}{\left(x^{2}-4\right)(x+1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Simplify } \frac{y-\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{y}}{\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{y}} \\
& \qquad \begin{aligned}
\frac{y-\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{y}}{\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{y}} & =\frac{\frac{y^{2}-\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)}{y}}{\frac{(y-x)}{x y}}=\frac{\frac{-x^{2}}{y}}{\frac{(y-x)}{x y}}=\frac{-x^{2}}{y} \times \frac{x y}{(y-x)} \\
& =\frac{-x^{3} y}{y(y-x)}=\frac{-x^{3}}{y-x}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 1.5 Binomial Expansions

We expand $(a+b)^{2}$ as $a^{2}+2 a b+b^{2}$.
Also $(a+b)^{3}=(a+b)(a+b)^{2}=(a+b)\left(a^{2}+2 a b+b^{2}\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =a^{3}+2 a^{2} b+a b^{2}+a^{2} b+2 a b^{2}+b^{3} \\
& =a^{3}+3 a^{2} b+3 a b^{2}+b^{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

However with higher powers this method is too time consuming.
Examining a number of expansions the following patterns are noted:
$(a+b)^{2}=1 a^{2}+\mathbf{2} a b+1 b^{2}$
$(a+b)^{3}=1 a^{3}+\mathbf{3} a^{2} b+\mathbf{3} a b^{2}+1 b^{3}$
$(a+b)^{4}=1 a^{4}+\mathbf{4} a^{3} b+\mathbf{6} a^{2} b^{2}+\mathbf{4} a b^{3}+1 b^{4}$
$(a+b)^{5}=\mathbf{1} a^{5}+\mathbf{5} a^{4} b+\mathbf{1 0} a^{3} b^{2}+\mathbf{1 0} a^{2} b^{3}+\mathbf{5} a b^{4}+\mathbf{1} b^{5}$

1. The powers of $a$ decrease by 1 from term to term, $a^{5}, a^{4}, a^{3}, a^{2}, a$.
2. The powers of $b$ increase by 1 from term to term $b, b^{2}, b^{3}, b^{4}, b^{5}$
3. The sum of the powers of $a$ and $b$ for each term is $5, a^{4} b^{1}, a^{3} b^{2}, a^{2} b^{3}, a^{1} b^{4}$.
4. The number of terms in each expansion is 1 greater than the power. i.e. $(a+b)^{3}$ has 4 terms, $(a+b)^{4}$ has 5 terms, $(a+b)^{5}$ has 6 terms etc.
5. The coefficients form Pascal's triangle.

|  |  | 1 |  |  | $\binom{0}{0}$ |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  |  | 1 | 1 |  |  |  |  | $\binom{1}{0}$ | $\binom{1}{1}$ |  |  | ..Row 1 |
|  | 1 | 2 | 1 |  |  |  | $\binom{2}{0}$ | $\binom{2}{1}$ | $\binom{2}{2}$ |  |  | ..Row 2 |
|  | 1 | 3 | 3 | 1 |  |  | $\binom{3}{0}$ | $\binom{3}{1}$ | $\binom{3}{2}$ | $\binom{3}{3}$ |  | ..Row 3 |
| 1 | 4 | 6 | 4 | 1 |  | $\binom{4}{0}$ | $\binom{4}{1}$ | $\binom{4}{2}$ | $\binom{4}{3}$ | $\binom{4}{4}$ |  | ..Row 4 |
| 1 | 5 | 10 | 10 | 5 | 1 | $\binom{5}{0}$ | $\binom{5}{1}$ | $\binom{5}{2}$ | $\binom{5}{3}$ | $\binom{5}{4}$ | $\binom{5}{5}$ | ..Row 5 |

The coefficients can be expressed in terms of combinations (see Chapter 5 - Probability) where $\binom{n}{r}$ stands for the number of ways of choosing $r$ objects from $n$ different objects.
So $(a+b)^{5}=\binom{5}{0} a^{5}+\binom{5}{1} a^{4} b+\binom{5}{2} a^{3} b^{2}+\binom{5}{3} a^{2} b^{3}+\binom{5}{4} a b^{4}+\binom{5}{5} b^{5}$
All of the coefficients can be quickly evaluated using a calculator with an $\boldsymbol{n} \boldsymbol{C r}$ function.
For example $\binom{5}{4}$, press $5|n C r| 4=5$ and $\binom{9}{3}$, press $9 \square n C r=3=84$
In general we can write,
$(a+b)^{n}=\binom{n}{0} a^{n}+\binom{n}{1} a^{n-1} b+\binom{n}{2} a^{n-2} b^{2}+\binom{n}{3} a^{n-3} b^{3}+\ldots$ where the general term of this expansion is written as, $\binom{n}{r} a^{n-r} b^{r}$.

## Example 1

Expand fully
(i) $(p+q)^{6}$
(ii) $(2 x-3 y)^{4}$
(i) $(p+q)^{6}=\binom{6}{0} p^{6}+\binom{6}{1} p^{5} q+\binom{6}{2} p^{4} q^{2}+\binom{6}{3} p^{3} q^{3}+\binom{6}{4} p^{2} q^{4}+\binom{6}{5} p q^{5}+\binom{6}{6} q^{6}$

$$
=p^{6}+6 p^{5} q+15 p^{4} q^{2}+20 p^{3} q^{3}+15 p^{2} q^{4}+6 p q^{5}+q^{6}
$$

(ii) $(2 x-3 y)^{4}$ by comparison with a general expansion we let $a=2 x, b=-3 y$ and $n=4$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad(2 x-3 y)^{4}= \\
& \begin{aligned}
\binom{4}{0}(2 x)^{4}+\binom{4}{1}(2 x)^{3}(-3 y)+\binom{4}{2}(2 x)^{2}(-3 y)^{2}+\binom{4}{1}(2 x)^{1}(-3 y)^{3}+\binom{4}{4}(-3 y)^{4} \\
\quad=16 x^{4}-96 x^{3} y+216 x^{2} y^{2}-216 x y^{3}+81 y^{4}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

When calculating binomial coefficients we note that:

1. $\binom{n}{0}=\binom{n}{n}=1$, for all values of $n \in N$
2. $\binom{n}{1}=n$, for all values of $n \in N$
3. $\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n}{n-r}$ for all values of $n \in N$ i.e. $\binom{6}{4}=\binom{6}{2}$ and $\binom{8}{7}=\binom{8}{1}$
4. Since the binomial coefficients start with $\binom{n}{0}$, the 3rd coefficient is given by $\binom{n}{2}$

The binomial theorem gives a quick and efficient way to expand any binomial to a given power.
The formula for the theorem is given on page 20 of the Formulae and Tables booklet.

## Binomial Theorem

$$
(x+y)^{n}=\binom{n}{0} x^{n}+\binom{n}{1} x^{n-1} y+\binom{n}{2} x^{n-2} y^{2}+\ldots\binom{n}{r} x^{n-r} y^{r}+\ldots\binom{n}{n} y^{n}
$$

## Binomial coefficients

$$
\binom{n}{r}={ }^{n} C_{r}
$$

## Example 2

(i) Find the first 3 terms of the expansion of $(1-5 y)^{8}$
(ii) Find the fourth term of the expansion of $(3 a+b)^{7}$
(i) Comparing $(1-5 y)^{8}$ with $(x+y)^{n}$, we let $x=1, y=-5 y$ and $n=8$ in the general Binomial Expansion.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad(1-3 y)^{8} & =\binom{8}{0}+\binom{8}{1}(-5 y)+\binom{8}{2}(-5 y)^{2}+\ldots \\
& =1-40 y+700 y^{2}+\ldots
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) In the expansion of $(3 a+b)^{7}$ we let $x=3 a, y=b, n=7$ and for the fourth term let $\boldsymbol{r}=3$ in the general term. (since $r=0,1,2,3, \ldots$ )
$\binom{n}{r} a^{n-r} b^{r}=\binom{7}{3}(3 a)^{4} b^{3}=2835 a^{4} b^{3}$

## Section 1.6 Algebraic identities

The word identity occurs in many different areas of mathematics. It is used in trigonometry, in sets, in functions and in algebra.

In an identity, all coefficients of like powers are equal.
An identity must be true for all values of the independent variable.

If $3 x+7=a x+b$ for all values of $\boldsymbol{x}$, this is called an algebraic identity.
We can conclude that for this to be true, then $a=3$ and $b=7$.
When two expressions are equal for all values of $\boldsymbol{x}$, then the resulting equation is an identity. All coefficients of like powers of $x$ in an identity are equal.

Generally, if $a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d=p x^{3}+q x^{2}+r x+s$ for all values of $x$, then $a=p, b=q, c=r, d=s$.

Also, if $a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d=q x^{2}+s$ for all values of $x$, then $a=c=0$ and $b=q, d=s$.

This property is used to find unknown coefficients in certain equations.

## Example 1

Find the values of $a$ and $b$ given that $(2 x+a)^{2}=4 x^{2}+12 x+b$, for all values of $\boldsymbol{x}$.
Given $\quad(2 x+a)^{2}=4 x^{2}+12 x+b$ for all values of $x$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 4 x^{2}+4 a x+a^{2}=4 x^{2}+12 x+b \\
& 4 a=12 \quad(\text { comparing like powers of } x) \quad \therefore a=3 \\
& \text { and } a^{2}=b \quad(\text { comparing the constant terms }) \quad \therefore \quad 3^{2}=9=b .
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

If $3 t^{2} x-3 p x+c-2 t^{3}=0$ for all values of $\boldsymbol{x}$, find $c$ in terms of $p$.
Given $3 t^{2} x-3 p x+c-2 t^{3}=0$ for all values of $x$,
$\therefore \quad\left(3 t^{2}-3 p\right) x+c-2 t^{3}=(0) x+(0) \ldots$ writing both sides as polynomials in $x$
$\therefore 3 t^{2}-3 p=0 \quad$ (comparing like powers of $\left.x\right) \quad \therefore t=\sqrt{p}$
and $c-2 t^{3}=0$ (comparing the constant terms) $\therefore c=2 t^{3}$

$$
\therefore c=2(\sqrt{p})^{3}=2 p^{\frac{3}{2}}
$$

Algebraic identities can also be used to create partial fractions from a given fraction.
For example, $\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)}=\frac{A}{(x+1)}+\frac{B}{(x-2)}$ where $A$ and $B \in Q$.

## Example 3

Given $\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)}=\frac{A}{(x+1)}+\frac{B}{(x-2)}$ for all values of $x$, find the values of $A$ and $B$.

$$
\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)}=\frac{A}{(x+1)}+\frac{B}{(x-2)}=\frac{A(x-2)+B(x+1)}{(x+1)(x-2)}
$$

$\therefore \quad 1=A(x-2)+B(x+1)$ for all values of $x$.
We can find values of $A$ and $B$ using two different methods.

Method 1: Since this equation must be true for all values of $x$, by picking two suitable values of $x, A$ and $B$ can be easily evaluated.

Since

$$
1=A(x-2)+B(x+1)
$$

Let $x=2 \quad \therefore 1=A(0)+B(2+1) \quad \therefore \quad B=\frac{1}{3}$
Let $x=-1 \quad \therefore \quad 1=A(-1-2)+B(0) \quad \therefore \quad 1=-3 A \Rightarrow A=-\frac{1}{3}$
Method 2: Equating coefficients of like powers and then solve using simultaneous equations.

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 & =A(x-2)+B(x+1) \\
1 & =A x-2 A+B x+B \\
1 & =A x+B x-2 A+B \\
1 & =x(A+B)-2 A+B \\
x(0)+1 & =x(A+B)-2 A+B \text { for all values of } x .
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad 0=A+B$ and $1=-2 A+B \ldots$ equating like powers of $x$ and constant terms
$\therefore A=-B$ and using substitution, $1=-2(-B)+B=3 B$.
$\therefore \quad B=\frac{1}{3}$ and $A=-\frac{1}{3}$

$$
\therefore \quad \frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)}=\frac{A}{(x+1)}+\frac{B}{(x-2)}=\frac{-1}{3(x+1)}+\frac{1}{3(x-2)}
$$

## Algebraic identities and factors

If $x^{2}-a x+b$ is a factor of $x^{3}+2 a x^{2}+4 b x+c$, using algebraic identities we can find a relationship between the coefficients $a, b$ and $c$.

It is important to realise that when a factor is divided into an expression, there can be no remainder by definition of a factor.

$$
\begin{gathered}
x^{2}-a x+b \frac{x+3 a}{x^{3}+2 a x^{2}+4 b x+c} \\
\frac{x^{3}-a x^{2}+b x}{3 a x^{2}+3 b x+c} \\
\frac{3 a x^{2}-3 a^{2} x+3 a b}{x\left(3 b+3 a^{2}\right)+c}-3 a b
\end{gathered}
$$

Since there can be no remainder, we can conclude that for all values of $\boldsymbol{x}$,
(i) $3 b+3 a^{2}=0$, i.e. $b=-a^{2}$ and
(ii) $c-3 a b=0$, i.e. $c=3 a b$

The same results can be obtained by letting the missing factor $=(x+k)$.

$$
\therefore(x+k)\left(x^{2}-a x+b\right)=x^{3}+2 a x^{2}+4 b x+c
$$

Expanding the left-hand side we get,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x^{3}-a x^{2}+b x+k x^{2}-a k x+b k=x^{3}+2 a x^{2}+4 b x+c \quad \ldots \text { for all values of } \boldsymbol{x} . \\
\therefore \quad & x^{3}+(k-a) x^{2}+(b-a k) x+b k=x^{3}+2 a x^{2}+4 b x+c \quad \ldots \text { grouping like terms. }
\end{aligned}
$$

Comparing coefficients of $x^{2}: \quad(k-a)=2 a$, hence $k=3 a$ as above.
Comparing coefficients of $x: \quad(b-a k)=4 b$
$\left(b-3 a^{2}\right)=4 b$, hence $3 b=-3 a^{2}$, i.e. $b=-a^{2}$ as above.
Finally, comparing constant terms: $\quad b k=c$
$\therefore \quad 3 a b=c$, again the same as above.

## Example 4

Given that $(x-t)^{2}$ is a factor of $x^{3}+3 p x+c$, show that $p=-t^{2}$ and $c=2 t^{3}$.
$(x-t)^{2}=x^{2}-2 x t+t^{2}$ and using long division we get;

$$
\begin{gathered}
\qquad x^{2}-2 x t+t^{2} \frac{x+2 t}{x^{3}+3 p x+c} \quad\left(\text { note: there is no } x^{2} \text { term }\right) \\
\frac{x^{3}-2 t x^{2}+t^{2} x}{2 t x^{2}-t^{2} x+3 p x}+c \\
\text { (rewriting this line as) } \ldots 2 t x^{2}+\left(3 p-t^{2}\right) x+c \ldots \text { (factorising, } x \text {, from the previous line) } \\
\frac{2 t x^{2}-4 t^{2} x+2 t^{3}}{\left(3 p+3 t^{2}\right) x+c}-2 t^{3} \quad(=\text { remainder })
\end{gathered}
$$

Since we should get no remainder, $\left(3 p+3 t^{2}\right) x+c-2 t^{2}=0$ for all values of $\boldsymbol{x}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \quad \therefore \quad\left(3 p+3 t^{2}\right) x+c-2 t^{3}=(0) x+0 \quad \text { for all values of } x \text {. } \\
& \therefore \quad 3 p+3 t^{2}=0 \rightarrow p=-t^{2} \\
& \text { and } \quad+c-2 t^{3}=0 \rightarrow c=2 t^{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

(Note: The factors of $x^{3}+3 p x+c$ are $x^{2}-2 x t+t^{2}$ and $x+2 t$.)

## Example 5

$2 x-\sqrt{3}$ is a factor of $4 x^{2}-2(1+\sqrt{3}) x+\sqrt{3} ;$ find the second factor.
Let the second factor take the form $(a x+b)$.
(Note: $a$ needs to be introduced because the coefficient of $x^{2}$ is 4 ; it should be clear that $a=2$ )

Then $(2 x-\sqrt{3})(a x+b)=4 x^{2}-2(1+\sqrt{3}) x+\sqrt{3}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 a x^{2}+2 b x-\sqrt{3} a x-\sqrt{3} b=4 x^{2}-2(1+\sqrt{3}) x+\sqrt{3} \\
& 2 a x^{2}+(2 b-\sqrt{3} a) x-\sqrt{3} b=4 x^{2}-2(1+\sqrt{3}) x+\sqrt{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

Equating coefficients of like powers,
(i) $\left(x^{2}\right) \ldots 2 a=4 \Rightarrow a=2$
(ii) $(x) \ldots+(2 b-\sqrt{3} a)=-2(1+\sqrt{3})$
since $a=2, \Rightarrow 2 b-2 \sqrt{3}=-2-2 \sqrt{3}$
$\therefore b=-1$
(iii) (comparing the constants) $\ldots-\sqrt{3} b=\sqrt{3}$, verifying that $b=-1$.

Therefore the second factor is $2 x-1$.

## Section 1.7 Manipulating formulae

The area of a disc is given by the formula $A=\pi r^{2}$.
$A$ is said to be defined in terms of $r(r$ is the independent variable).

If we know $r$, we can find $A$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-032.jpg?height=218&width=224&top_left_y=249&top_left_x=1260)

For example, if $r=3$, then $A=9 \pi$; if $r=8$, then $A=64 \pi$, etc..
In some cases we may need to find $r$ in terms $A$, i.e. make $r$ the subject of the equation.
$\therefore \quad \pi r^{2}=A \Rightarrow r^{2}=\frac{A}{\pi} \Rightarrow r=\sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} \ldots r$ is now defined in terms of $A$.
Thus, if we know the area of the circle, we can find the radius.
For example, if $A=9 \pi$, then $r=\sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} \Rightarrow r=\sqrt{\frac{9 \pi}{\pi}}=\sqrt{9}=3$.

## Example 1

(i) If $v^{2}=u^{2}+2 a s$, express $a$ in terms of $v, u$ and $s$.
(ii) If $\sqrt{\frac{x+y}{x-y}}=\frac{1}{2}$, express $y$ in terms of $x$. Hence find the value of $y$ when $x=5$.
(i) $v^{2}=u^{2}+2 a s$

$$
\begin{aligned}
u^{2}+2 a s & =v^{2} \\
2 a s & =v^{2}-u^{2} \\
\therefore a & =\frac{v^{2}-u^{2}}{2 s}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $\sqrt{\frac{x+y}{x-y}}=\frac{1}{2}$
$\frac{x+y}{x-y}=\frac{1}{4} \quad \ldots$ squaring both sides
$4(x+y)=x-y \ldots$ multiplying both sides by $4(x-y)$
$4 x+4 y=x-y \quad \ldots$ expanding the left-hand side
$y+4 y=x-4 x \quad \ldots$ gathering only $y$ terms on the left-hand side
$5 y=-3 x$
$y=\frac{-3 x}{5} \ldots$ finding $y$ in terms of $x$
When $x=5, \quad y=\frac{-3(5)}{5}=-3$.

## Example 2

A container in the shape of an inverted cone is used to hold liquid.
Given $\tan \theta=\frac{r}{h}$, express the volume, $V$, in terms of the depth, $h$, of the liquid and the angle $\theta$.

Volume of a cone, $V=\frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h$
But $\tan \theta=\frac{r}{h} \Rightarrow h \tan \theta=r$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-033.jpg?height=378&width=288&top_left_y=266&top_left_x=1254)

$$
V=\frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h=\frac{\pi}{3}(h \tan \theta)^{2} h=\frac{\pi}{3} h^{3} \tan ^{2} \theta
$$

## Example 3

Given $x=\frac{t+4}{3 t+1}$, find $t$ in terms of $x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x=\frac{t+4}{3 t+1} \\
& x(3 t+1)=t+4 \quad \ldots \text { multiplying both sides by } 3 t+1 \\
& 3 t x+x=t+4 \quad \ldots \text { expanding the left-hand side } \\
& 3 t x-t=4-x \quad \ldots \text { gathering only } t \text { terms on the left-hand side } \\
& t(3 x-1)=4-x \quad \ldots \text { factorising } \\
& t=\frac{4-x}{3 x-1} \ldots \text { dividing both sides by } 3 x-1
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 1.8 Algebraic patterns, an introduction

1. Linear Each polynomial function creates a pattern which can be studied both numerically and graphically.

Patterns such as $0,3,6,9, \ldots$ can be described by the function

$$
f(x)=(y)=3 x, \text { where } x \geqslant 0, x \in N .
$$

Patterns such as $1,4,7,10, \ldots$ can be described by the function

$$
f(x)=(y)=3 x+1, \text { where } x \geqslant 0, x \in N .
$$

Patterns such as $2,-2,-6,-10 \ldots$ can be described by the function

$$
f(x)=(y)=2-4 x, \text { where } x \geqslant 0, x \in N .
$$

Each of these number patterns has a constant amount added or subtracted between terms and each, when graphed, produces a straight line as shown.
Functions of the form $f(x)=y=m x+c$ are called linear functions.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-035.jpg?height=951&width=555&top_left_y=1283&top_left_x=1076)

In a linear pattern, the difference between consecutive terms (called the 1st difference) gives $\boldsymbol{m}$, the slope of the line.

|  |  |  |  |  |  | $\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{m} \boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{c}$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Pattern | 0 | 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | $f(x)=(y)=3 x$ |
| 1st Difference |  | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Pattern | 1 | 4 | 7 | 10 | 13 | $f(x)=(y)=3 x+1$ |
| 1st Difference |  | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Pattern | 2 | -2 | -6 | -10 | -14 | $f(x)=(y)=2-4 x$ |
| 1st Difference |  | -4 | -4 | -4 | -4 |  |

The starting point of each pattern determines $c$, the constant term. We note that when $x=0$, geometrically, we get the $y$-axis intercept, c.
2. Quadratic Patterns such as $0,1,4,9,16 \ldots$ do not have a constant amount added or subtracted between terms.
Studying the 1 st differences between terms, we get $1,3,5,7, \ldots$.
The 2 nd difference ( $3-1$ ), ( $5-3$ ), ... however is a constant, 2 .
Such patterns can be represented by the function $f(x)=(y)=x^{2}$ for $x \geqslant 0$.
Functions of the form $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{2}}+\boldsymbol{b}$ create similar patterns.

| Pattern | 0 | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | $f(x)=(y)=x^{2}$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1st Difference |  | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 |  |
| 2nd Difference |  |  | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |  |
| Pattern | 2 | 3 | 6 | 11 | 18 | 27 | $f(x)=(y)=x^{2}+2$ |
| 1st Difference |  | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 |  |
| 2nd Difference |  |  | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Pattern | -3 | -2 | 1 | 6 | 13 | 22 | $f(x)=(y)=x^{2}-3$ |
| 1st Difference |  | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 |  |
| 2nd Difference |  |  | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Pattern | 2 | 1 | -2 | -7 | -14 | -23 | $f(x)=(y)=2-x^{2}$ |
| 1st Difference |  | -1 | -3 | -5 | -7 | -9 |  |
| 2nd Difference |  |  | -2 | -2 | -2 | -2 |  |

As can be seen from the graphs, the curves are symmetrical about the line $x=0$ ( $y$-axis).
Patterns of the form $f(x)=x^{2}+b$ are $\cup$-shaped.
Patterns of the form $f(x)=b-x^{2}$ are $\cap$-shaped.
Consider the following pattern.

| Pattern | 4 | 7 | 16 | 31 | 52 | 79 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1st Difference |  | 3 | 9 | 15 | 21 | 27 |
| 2nd Difference |  |  | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 |

Because the 2nd difference is a constant, we know this is a quadratic pattern of the form

$$
a x^{2}+b x+c, x \geqslant 0, x \in N .
$$

When $x=0, a x^{2}+b x+c=4, \therefore c=4$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-037.jpg?height=503&width=409&top_left_y=173&top_left_x=1219)

If $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$, the second difference $=2 a$.

When $x=1, a x^{2}+b x+4=7, \therefore a+b+4=7$
When $x=2, a x^{2}+b x+4=16, \therefore 4 a+2 b+4=16$
Solving we find $a=3, b=0$
Thus the pattern can be represented by the polynomial function $f(x)=3 x^{2}+4$.

## Example 1

Examine each of the following patterns of numbers and determine if there is a linear or quadratic relationship between the terms.
Write an algebraic expression for each set of numbers:
(a) $-2,1,4,7, \ldots$
(b) $3,5,11,21, \ldots$

| Pattern | -2 | 1 | 4 | 7 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1st Difference |  | 3 | 3 | 3 |

(a) Since the first difference is a constant, this indicates a linear relationship $f(x)=a x+b$.
$a=3$ and $b=-2$,
$\therefore f(x)=3 x-2, x \geqslant 0$.

| Pattern | 3 | 5 | 11 | 21 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1st Difference |  | 2 | 6 | 10 |
| 2nd Difference |  |  | 4 | 4 |

(b) Since the second difference is a constant, this indicates a quadratic relationship

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(x)=a x^{2}+b . \\
& 4=2 a \Rightarrow a=2 \text { and } b=3, \\
& \therefore \quad f(x)=2 x^{2}+3, x \geqslant 0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

More complex quadratic patterns of the form $a x^{2}+b x+c$ can be formed in two stages; first to identify the quadratic element $x^{2}$, then subtracting this from the pattern to form the linear element $b x+c$.

## Example 2

Single matchsticks were used to form a sequence of patterns as shown. Find an algebraic quadratic expression
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-038.jpg?height=213&width=686&top_left_y=271&top_left_x=855) for the number of matchsticks needed for each pattern.
How many matchsticks are needed for the 10th pattern?

Counting the matchsticks needed for the first four patterns, we get the number pattern $4,10,18,28, \ldots$

| Pattern | 4 | 10 | 18 | 28 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1st Difference |  | 6 | 8 | 10 |
| 2nd Difference |  |  | 2 | 2 |

The 2 nd difference produces $2,2,2, \ldots$ etc.
So there is a quadratic element ( $x^{2}$ ) to this pattern.
Letting $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$, when $x=0, f(0)=c=4$.
Also the 2nd difference $=2 a=2, \therefore a=1$
When $x=1, f(1)=a+b+c=10$ $=1+b+4=10 \therefore b=5$
$\therefore \quad f(x)=x^{2}+5 x+4$ for $x \geqslant 0$
To get the 10 th pattern, we let $x=9$ (since pattern starts with $x=0$ )
$\therefore \quad f(9)=9^{2}+5(9)+4=130$ matchsticks needed.

Note: Linear and quadratic patterns of numbers are studied in greater depth in chapter 9.

Using your expression for $f(t)$, and trial and error, find in which hour the colony will have reached 529.

## Section 1.9 Solving equations

To solve an equation, we need to find the values of the given variable that satisfy the equation.
If $4 x-12=0$, then $x=3$ is the only solution of this equation.
If $x^{2}-5 x+6=0$, then $x=2$ and $x=3$ are both solutions of this equation.
If $y=4 x-12$, then $(x, y)=(4,4)$ is one of the many values of $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation.

Given $f(x)=4 x-12$,
then $x=3$ is the value that makes $f(x)=0$.
Therefore, $(x, y)=(3,0)$ is the solution of $y=4 x-12$.

Similarly, $(2,0)$ and $(3,0)$ are solutions of $y=x^{2}-5 x+6$.
The values of $x$ that make $y=0$ are called the roots of an equation.

If a graph of the function is plotted, the roots
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-040.jpg?height=466&width=708&top_left_y=163&top_left_x=924) are those points where the graph crosses the $x$-axis.

## Solving linear equations

Any equation of the form $\boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{a} \boldsymbol{x}+\mathbf{b}$, when plotted, creates a straight line.
Such equations are called linear equations.
To solve the equation $2 x+1=0$, we need to find the value of $x$ that makes $y=0$, i.e. where the line crosses the $x$-axis.

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 x+1 & =0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad x=\frac{-1}{2} & =-0.5
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, to solve the equation $2 x+1=2$, we have to find the value of $x$ that makes $y=2$, i.e. where the line crosses the line $y=2$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 x+1=2 \\
\Rightarrow & x=\frac{1}{2}=0.5
\end{aligned}
$$

In each case, there is only one value of $x$ (one root) produced.

## Section 1.10 Solving simultaneous linear equations

## 1. Solving simultaneous linear equations with two variables

The linear equation $y=\frac{2}{3} x-3$ can be rearranged as follows:
$2 x-3 y-9=0$ is the equation of the same

Standard form of the equation of a line:

$$
a x+b y+c=0
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
y & =\frac{2}{3} x-3 \\
3 y & =2 x-9
\end{aligned}
$$

line, expressed in standard form.

This equation has two variables $(x, y)$ for which there are many solutions.
However, if we have two equations in $x$ and $y$, they are either
(a) parallel, with no point of intersection or
(b) they intersect at a point $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$, common to both lines.

In this diagram, the lines $2 x-y+1=0$ and $3 x+y-4=0$ are plotted.

They have a point of intersection $\mathrm{A}(x, y)=\left(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{11}{5}\right)$ which
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-042.jpg?height=499&width=482&top_left_y=177&top_left_x=1145) satisfies both equations at the same time, i.e. simultaneously.
We can solve two linear equations (i.e. find their point of intersection) by:
(i) substitution
(ii) elimination
(iii) graphically (as above).

## Example 1

Solve the equations $3 x-y=1$ and $x-2 y=-8$.
Take $x-2 y=-8$ and rearrange the terms, finding $\boldsymbol{x}$ in terms of $\boldsymbol{y}$,

$$
\rightarrow x=-8+2 y
$$

Substitute this expression for $x$ into the second linear equation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
3 x-y=1 \text { becomes } 3(-8+2 y)-y & =1 \\
-24+6 y-y & =1 \ldots \text { expanding } \\
5 y & =25 \\
y & =5
\end{aligned}
$$

If $y=5$, then $x=-8+2 y$ becomes $x=-8+2(5)=2$
Therefore $(x, y)=(2,5)$ is the point of intersection.
[Note: Since $3(2)-(5)=1$ and $(2)-2(5)=-8$, the point $(2,5)$ is on both lines.]

Note 1: The technique for solving equations by substitution will be used later to find the point(s) of intersection of a line and a curve.

Note 2: Either variable can be substituted.
(Always choose the variable that is easiest to isolate.)

## Example 2

Solve the equations $2 x-5 y=9$ and $3 x+2 y=4$.
Let A be $2 x-5 y=9$
Let B be $3 x+2 y=4$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad 3 \mathrm{~A}: 6 x-15 y & =27 \\
\text { and } \quad 2 \mathrm{~B}: \frac{6 x+4 y}{6} & =8 \\
-19 y & =19 \ldots \text { Subtracting to eliminate } x \\
y & =-1
\end{aligned}
$$

Now substituting $y=-1$ into A , we get $2 x-5(-1)=9$

$$
\begin{array}{r}
2 x=4 \\
x=2
\end{array}
$$

The point of intersection is $(x, y)=(2,-1)$.
[Note: $2(2)-5(-1)=9$ and $3(2)+2(-1)=4$ and so this point is on both lines.]

## 2. Solving simultaneous equations with three variables

$x+y+z=6$ is an equation with three variables (three dimensions).
To plot this equation we need three axes, $x, y$ and $z$-axes, at right angles to one another.
When plotted, this equation represents a plane of points.
If three planes are plotted on the same axes, there will be one point of intersection ( $x, y, z$,) provided none of the planes are parallel.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-043.jpg?height=510&width=757&top_left_y=1334&top_left_x=541)

To solve an equation with three unknowns,
(i) reduce the three equations to two by eliminating one of the unknowns
(ii) choose an unknown that is easy to isolate
(iii) eliminate this unknown from all three equations, taking them two at a time
(iv) solve these two equations as before
(v) use your values for these unknowns in one of the original equations to solve for the third unknown
(vi) check your solutions in all equations.

## Example 3

Solve the simultaneous equations: A: $x+y+z=6$
B: $2 x+y-z=1$
C: $4 x-3 y+2 z=4$
Eliminating $z$ from all three equations we get,
A: $x+y+z=6$
2B: $4 x+2 y-2 z=2$
B: $2 x+y-z=1$
C: $4 x-3 y+2 z=4$
D: $3 x+2 y=7$
adding A and B
E: $8 x-y=6$
adding 2B and C
D: $3 x+2 y=7$
2E: $16 x-2 y=12$
$19 x=19 \quad \ldots$ adding D and 2E

$$
x=1
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad \text { Using D: } \quad 3(1)+2 y & =7 \\
2 y & =4 \\
y & =2
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, using A: (1) $+(2)+z=6$

$$
\begin{gathered}
z=3 \quad \therefore \quad \text { the point of intersection is } \\
(x, y, z)=(1,2,3)
\end{gathered}
$$

[Note: A: (1) + (2) + (3) = 6, and
B: $2(1)+(2)-(3)=1$, and
C: $4(1)-3(2)+2(3)=4$ and so this point satisfies all three equations]

## 3. Simultaneous equations in context

## Example 4

An opera was attended by 240 people. Two ticket prices, $€ 31$ and $€ 16$, were available. If the total takings on the night were $€ 5595$, find using this data
(i) two linear equations connecting the two types of tickets sold
(ii) the number of € 31 tickets sold
(iii) the number of $€ 16$ tickets sold.

Let $x$ represent the number of $€ 16$ tickets sold and $y$ represent the number of $€ 31$ tickets sold.
(i) Since 240 people attended altogether, then

A: $x+y=240$
If the receipts were $€ 5595$, then
B: $16 x+31 y=5595$
(ii) Solving, we get16A: $16 x+16 y=3840$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { B: } 16 x+31 y & =5595 \\
-15 y & =-1755 \quad(\text { subtracting }) \\
y & =117, \text { i.e. } 117 € 31 \text { tickets were sold }
\end{aligned}
$$

(iii) Using $y=117: \quad x+(117)=240$
$x=123$, i.e. $123 € 16$ tickets were sold.

## Example 5

Fifty, twenty and ten cent coins are collected from a coin machine and counted. The total value of the coins is $€ 32$. When counting, the cashier noted that twice the number of twenty cent coins, added to the number of ten cent coins, equalled three times the number of fifty cent coins. She then noticed that four times the number of fifty cent coins, added to the number of ten cent coins, equalled six times the number of twenty cent coins.
Find the number of each type of coin in the machine.
Let $x=$ the number of 50 cent coins
Let $y=$ the number of 20 cent coins
Let $z=$ the number of 10 cent coins.
(i) $50 x+20 y+10 z=3200 \ldots € 32=3200 c$
(ii) $2 y+z=3 x$
(iii) $4 x+z=6 y$

Rearranging the equations into standard form, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { A: } 50 x+20 y+10 z=3200 \\
& \text { B: } 3 x-2 y-z=0 \\
& \text { C: } 4 x-6 y+z=0
\end{aligned}
$$

Adding B and C eliminates $z \quad \therefore \mathrm{~B}+\mathrm{C} \Rightarrow 7 x-8 y=0$.
Adding A and 10B also eliminates $z$ (and $y$ in this case) $\therefore \mathrm{A}: 50 x+20 y+10 z=3200$

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { 10B: } 30 x-20 y-10 z=0 \\
\mathrm{~A}+10 \mathrm{~B} \Rightarrow 80 x=3200 \\
\therefore x=40
\end{gathered}
$$

Since $7 x-8 y=0 \Rightarrow 7(40)-8 y=0$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow 280-8 y=0 \\
& \Rightarrow y=35
\end{aligned}
$$

Also, $3 x-2 y-z=0 \Rightarrow 3(40)-2(35)-z=0 \quad \therefore z=120-70=50$.
$\therefore(x, y, z)=(40,35,50)$.
There are forty 50 c coins, thirty-five 20 c coins and fifty 10 c coins in the machine.

## Revision Exercise 1 (Extended-Response Questions)

1. A football club wanted to organise a family day as a fund-raiser.

They decided to pre-sell tickets at $€ 5.00$ for adults and $€ 2.50$ for children aged 6 years or younger.
Last year, when they held a similar event 13000 attended.

## Section 2.1 Quadratic equations

As mentioned already, when the highest power of a variable in a polynomial is two, the resulting expression is called a quadratic expression.
The following are examples of quadratic equations:
(i) $3 x^{2}+4 x-5=0$
(ii) $6=3 t+8 t^{2}$
(iii) $A=2 \pi r h+2 \pi r^{2}$

Each quadratic equation has two solutions (or roots).

## Solving quadratic equations

Techniques for solving quadratic equations include
(i) factorising
(ii) quadratic formula
(iii) graphical methods
(iv) substitution.

## (i) Factorising methods (as in Chapter 1)

If an equation which equates to zero can be factorised, then at least one of its factors must equal zero.

If $(a)(b)=0$, then $\boldsymbol{a}=\mathbf{0}$ or $\boldsymbol{b}=\mathbf{0}$.

## Example 1

Use factors to solve
(i) $x^{2}-5 x-6=0$
(ii) $y^{2}-5 y=0$
(iii) $4 t^{2}-100=0$
(i) $x^{2}-5 x-6=0$
(ii) $y^{2}-5 y=0$
(iii) $4 t^{2}-100=0$
$(x-6)(x+1)=0$
$y(y-5)=0$
$\therefore x-6=0 \rightarrow x=6$
$\therefore y=0$
or $x+1=0 \rightarrow x=-1$
or $y-5=0 \rightarrow y=+5$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 4\left(t^{2}-25\right)=0 \\
& 4(t-5)(t+5)=0 \\
& \therefore t-5=0 \rightarrow t=+5 \\
& \text { or } t+5=0 \rightarrow t=-5
\end{aligned}
$$

Solutions (roots)
(i) $x=\{6,-1\}$
(ii) $y=\{0,5\}$
(iii) $t=\{5,-5\}$

## (ii) Quadratic formula

The quadratic formula $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$ can be used to solve any quadratic equation of the form $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { If } \quad a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \\
& \text { then } \quad x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}
\end{aligned}
$$

It is good practice to write out the coefficients $a, b$, and $c$ separately before applying the formula.

## Example 2

Solve $x-6=\frac{3}{x}$. (Note: It is not always obvious that we are dealing with an equation of the form $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$.)

$$
x-6=\frac{3}{x}
$$

Rearranging $\rightarrow x^{2}-6 x=3 \Rightarrow x^{2}-6 x-3=0$
$\therefore \quad a=1, b=-6, c=-3$, hence $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}=\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^{2}-4(1)(-3)}}{2(1)}$

$$
x=\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{48}}{2}=\frac{6 \pm 4 \sqrt{3}}{2}=3 \pm 2 \sqrt{3}
$$

$\therefore \quad x=3+2 \sqrt{3}$ or $x=3-2 \sqrt{3}$ are the roots (solutions) of the equation.

## (iii) Graphical methods

Graphing the expression $y=x^{2}-5 x+1,0 \leqslant x \leqslant 5$, we get the points $(0,1),(1,-3),(2,-5),(3,-5),(4,-3),(5,1)$, which, when plotted, produce the familiar $\cup$-shaped curve.

To solve $y=x^{2}-5 x+1=0$ graphically, we must find the points on the curve where $y=0$, i.e. the points $\mathrm{G}(0.2,0)$ and $\mathrm{H}(4.8,0)$.
$\therefore \quad$ The roots are 0.2 and 4.8.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-054.jpg?height=550&width=496&top_left_y=1526&top_left_x=1133)

When the expression $y=-x^{2}-3 x+2$ is plotted, a $\cap$-shaped graph results.
Again, the roots of the equation $-x^{2}-3 x+2=0$ occur where the curve intersects the $x$-axis (i.e. where $y=0$ ), i.e. the points $\mathrm{G}(-3.6,0)$ and $\mathrm{H}(0.6,0)$.

Graphical methods can only give approximate values for the roots of an equation.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-055.jpg?height=500&width=701&top_left_y=172&top_left_x=927)

To solve the equation $-x^{2}-3 x+2=3$, we can consider two approaches;
(i) To find the points on the curve $y=-x^{2}-3 x+2$ where $y=3$ (i.e.S, P) or
(ii) To create the new curve $y=-x^{2}-3 x+2-3=-x^{2}-3 x-1$ and solve $-x^{2}-3 x-1=0$.

Both are different curves but with the same solutions (roots) for Q and $\mathrm{S}, x \cong-2.6$ and for P and $\mathrm{R}, x \cong 0.4$.
(iv) Substitution

The following types of equations can be solved by choosing a suitable substitution which creates a new quadratic equation in standard form.
(i) $\left(t-\frac{6}{t}\right)^{2}-6\left(t-\frac{6}{t}\right)+5=0 \quad$ let $u=\left(t-\frac{6}{t}\right), \quad$ then $u^{2}-6 u+5=0$
(ii) $x^{4}+x^{2}-6=0 \quad$ let $u=x^{2}, \quad$ then $u^{2}+u-6=0$
(iii) $2 x+3 \sqrt{x}=5 \quad$ let $u=\sqrt{x}$, then $2 u^{2}+3 u-5=0$

Once the values for $u$ have been found, the values for $x$ can then be obtained.

## Example 3

Solve $x^{4}+x^{2}-6=0$ for $x \in R$.
Let $u=x^{2}, \Rightarrow u^{2}=x^{4}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x^{4}+x^{2}-6=0 \Rightarrow u^{2}+u-6=0 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad(u+3)(u-2)=0 \\
& \quad u+3=0 \Rightarrow u=-3 \Rightarrow x^{2}=-3 \Rightarrow x= \pm \sqrt{(-3)} \\
& \text { or } u-2=0 \Rightarrow u=2 \Rightarrow x^{2}=2 \Rightarrow x= \pm \sqrt{(2)}
\end{aligned}
$$

$x= \pm \sqrt{(-3)}$, two imaginary roots which are not required.
$\therefore \quad x=+\sqrt{(2)},-\sqrt{(2)}$ are the solutions.
[Note: $(+\sqrt{(2)})^{4}+(+\sqrt{(2)})^{2}-6=0$ and $(-\sqrt{(2)})^{4}+(-\sqrt{(2)})^{2}-6=0$ ]

## Example 4

Solve $2 x+3 \sqrt{x}=5$ for $x \in R$.
Let $u=\sqrt{x} \Rightarrow u^{2}=x$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad 2 x+3 \sqrt{x}=5 & \Rightarrow 2 u^{2}+3 u-5=0 \\
& \Rightarrow(u-1)(2 u+5)=0 \\
& \Rightarrow u=1 \text { or } u=\frac{-5}{2} \\
& \therefore \quad \sqrt{x}=1 \text { or } \sqrt{x}=\frac{-5}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Remember:

The $\sqrt{b}$, where $b \geqslant 0$, is the non-negative square root of $b$. e.g $\sqrt{25}=5$.

But $\sqrt{x}$ must be a non-negative number.

$$
\therefore \quad \sqrt{x}=1, x=1
$$

Validating the solution; $x=1 \Rightarrow 2 x+3 \sqrt{x}=2(1)+3(\sqrt{1})=5$

## Section 2.2 Nature of quadratic roots

## 1. The discriminant

We have used the formula $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$ to solve quadratic equations of the form $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$, where $a, b, c \in R$.

The value of the expression ( $b^{2}-4 a c$ ) will determine the nature of the roots of this equation

$$
\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=\text { discriminant }
$$ and is called the discriminant of the equation.

## 2. Real and distinct roots

Real distinct roots occur when $\left(\boldsymbol{b}^{\mathbf{2}}-\mathbf{4} \boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{c}\right)>\mathbf{0}$.
e.g. $3 x^{2}+5 x-2=0 ; a=3, b=5, c=-2$;
$\therefore\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=\left[5^{2}-4(3)(-2)\right]=49>0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x & =\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \rightarrow x=\frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{49}}{6} \\
\rightarrow x & =\frac{-5+7}{6}, \frac{-5-7}{6}=(0.33,-2)
\end{aligned}
$$

In this case, the graph crosses the $x$-axis at two distinct places, $(-2,0)$ and (0.33, 0).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-059.jpg?height=500&width=536&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=1095)
$b^{2}-4 a c>0$

## 3. Real and equal roots

Real and equal roots occur when $\left(\boldsymbol{b}^{\mathbf{2}}-\mathbf{4} \boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{c}\right)=\mathbf{0}$.
e.g. $4 x^{2}-12 x+9=0 ; a=4, b=-12, c=9$;
$\therefore\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=[144-4(4)(9)]=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x & =\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \rightarrow x=\frac{12 \pm \sqrt{(0)}}{2.4} \\
& =\frac{12}{8}=\frac{3}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Only one solution occurs and the graph touches the $x$-axis at this point, $A\left(\frac{3}{2}, 0\right)$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-059.jpg?height=444&width=541&top_left_y=874&top_left_x=1087)

$$
b^{2}-4 a c=0
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-059.jpg?height=456&width=539&top_left_y=1483&top_left_x=1093)

$$
b^{2}-4 a c<0
$$

If we let $\sqrt{-1}=i$, then we can rewrite the solutions as follows:

$$
x=\frac{4+2 i}{2}, \frac{4-2 i}{2}=2+i, 2-i
$$

These points cannot be represented on the real plane. (We will study these types of numbers further in Complex Numbers book 5.)
We note that the curve does not cut (cross) the $x$-axis.

## 5. Rational roots

If ( $b^{2}-4 a c$ ) is a perfect square then $\sqrt{\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)}$ is a rational number and this means that the equation has rational roots. (Perfect squares are $1,4,9,16, \ldots$ or $\frac{16}{9}, \frac{4}{25} \ldots$ etc.) e.g. $3 x^{2}+5 x+2=0 ; a=3, b=5, c=2$; $\therefore\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=[25-4(3)(2)]=1$ which is a perfect square.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \Rightarrow x=\frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{(25-24)}}{2.3} \\
& \Rightarrow x=\frac{-5 \pm 1}{6}=\frac{-6}{6}, \frac{-4}{6}=-1,-\frac{2}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-060.jpg?height=453&width=633&top_left_y=231&top_left_x=994)

## In summary

1. If $\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)>0 \Rightarrow$ two different (distinct) real roots
2. If $\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=0 \Rightarrow$ two equal real roots
3. If $\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)<0 \Rightarrow$ two imaginary roots
4. If $\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)$ is a perfect square $\rightarrow$ rational roots

Note: When the phrase "has real roots" is used in questions, then this must be taken to mean "has either two real distinct roots or two equal (repeated) roots".

## Roots are real if $\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right) \geqslant 0$

## Example 1

Evaluate the discriminant of each of the following, stating whether the equation has
(i) two distinct real roots
(ii) two identical real roots
(iii) no real roots.
(a) $3 x^{2}+5 x-1=0$
(b) $49 x^{2}+42 x+9=0$
(c) $2 x^{2}+8 x+9=0$
(d) $2 x^{2}+7 x+4=0$
(a) $3 x^{2}+5 x-1=0 \rightarrow a=3, b=5, c=-1$.
$\therefore \quad\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=25-4(3)(-1)=37>0 \quad \therefore \quad$ two distinct real roots.
(b) $49 x^{2}+42 x+9=0 \rightarrow a=49, b=42, c=9$.
$\therefore \quad\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=1764-4(49)(9)=0 \quad \therefore$ two identical real roots.
(c) $2 x^{2}+8 x+9=0 \rightarrow a=2, b=8, c=9$.
$\therefore \quad\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=64-4(2)(9)=-8<0 \quad \therefore$ no real roots.
(d) $2 x^{2}+7 x+4=0 \rightarrow a=2, b=7, c=4$.
$\therefore \quad\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=49-4(2)(4)=17>0 \quad \therefore \quad$ two distinct real roots.

## Example 2

Find the values of $k$ so that $-8+k x-2 x^{2}=0$ has equal roots.

$$
-8+k x-2 x^{2}=0 \Rightarrow a=-2, b=k, c=-8
$$

For equal roots, we have that $\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=0$
$\therefore \quad\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=\left[k^{2}-4(-2)(-8)\right]$
$\therefore k^{2}-64=0 \quad \therefore k= \pm 8$

## Example 3

Given the equation $p x^{2}+(p+q) x+q=0$.
(i) Show that the roots are real for all values of $p$ and $q \in R$.
(ii) Show that the roots are rational.
(iii) Hence find
(a) the roots, in terms of $p$ and $q$
(b) the factors, in terms of $p$ and $q$.

$$
p x^{2}+(p+q) x+q=0 \rightarrow a=p, b=(p+q), c=q .
$$

(i) For real roots, we need to show that $\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right) \geqslant 0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right) & =(p+q)^{2}-4(p)(q) \\
& =p^{2}+2 p q+q^{2}-4 p q \\
& =p^{2}-2 p q+q^{2}=(p-q)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since (any real quantity) ${ }^{2}$ cannot be negative $\Rightarrow(p-q)^{2} \geqslant 0$.
$\therefore \quad\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right) \geqslant 0$
$\therefore$ the roots are real.
(ii) For rational roots, $\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)$ must be a perfect square.

Since $\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=(p-q)^{2}$, i.e. a perfect square,
$\therefore$ the roots are also rational.
(iii) (a) The roots are $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}=\frac{-(p+q) \pm \sqrt{(p-q)^{2}}}{2 p}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{-(p+q) \pm(p-q)}{2 p} \\
\therefore \quad x & =\frac{-2 q}{2 p}, \frac{-2 p}{2 p}=\frac{-q}{p},-1
\end{aligned}
$$

(b) Since $x=-\frac{q}{p} \Rightarrow p x+q=0$

Also $x=-1 \Rightarrow x+1=0$
$\therefore$ the factors of $p x^{2}+(p+q) x+q$ are $p x+q$ and $x+1$

## Exercise 2.2

1. By inspection, state which of the curves - $f, g$ and $h$ - have
(i) real and distinct roots

## Section 2.3 Solving quadratic and linear equations

To find the point(s) of intersection between a line and a curve, we use the technique of substitution. We have used this method already when solving simultaneous linear equations.

We note that in this case, the line may
(i) intersect the curve at two points
(ii) intersect at one point
(iii) or not intersect the curve
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-063.jpg?height=541&width=845&top_left_y=625&top_left_x=787) at all.

If there is just one point of intersection, the line is said to be a tangent to the curve.
The line $x-y=-1$ intersects the curve $y=x^{2}+5 x+1$ at two points, $\mathrm{A}(-4,-3)$ and $\mathrm{B}(0,1)$.
The line $x-y=3$ is a tangent to the curve $y=x^{2}+5 x+1$ at the point $\mathrm{E}(-2,-5)$.
The line $x-y=5$ does not intersect the curve.

## Example 1

Find the point(s) of intersection between
(i) $x-y=-1$
(ii) $x-y=3$ and the curve $y=x^{2}+5 x+1$.
(i) Since $x-y=-1$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\rightarrow-y & =-1-x \\
\rightarrow y & =(1+x)
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting $y=(1+x)$ into $y=x^{2}+5 x+1$, we get $(1+x)=x^{2}+5 x+1$.
$\therefore \quad 0=x^{2}+5 x+1-1-x=x^{2}+4 x$.
$\therefore \quad 0=x(x+4)$
$\therefore \quad(x+4)=0$ or $x=0$, i.e. $x=-4$ or 0 .
$\therefore \quad y=1-4=-3 \rightarrow(x, y)=(-4,-3)$
and $y=1-0=1 \rightarrow(x, y)=(0,1)$
$\therefore$ the points of intersection for $x-y=-1$ are $(-4,-3)$ and $(0,1)$.
(ii)

$$
\begin{aligned}
x-y & =3 \\
\rightarrow-y & =3-x \\
\rightarrow y & =(-3+x)
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting $y=(-3+x)$ into $y=x^{2}+5 x+1$,

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & (-3+x)=x^{2}+5 x+1 \\
& 0=x^{2}+5 x+1+3-x=x^{2}+4 x+4 \\
\therefore & (x+2)(x+2)=0 \\
\therefore & x=-2 \quad(\text { a repeated solution }) \\
\therefore & y=-3-2=-5 \rightarrow(x, y)=(-2,-5)
\end{array}
$$

$\therefore$ the point of intersection for $x-y=3$ is $(-2,-5)$.
$\therefore x-y=3$ is a tangent to the curve $y=x^{2}+5 x+1$ at the point $(-2,-5)$.

In summary, to find the point(s) of intersection between a line and a curve,
(i) isolate one of the variables in the equation of the line, e.g. $y=a x+b$.
(ii) Substitute this expression for $y$ into the equation for the curve $y=c x^{2}+d x+e$, i.e. $a x+b=c x^{2}+d x+e$ and simplify.
(iii) Solve the resulting quadratic equation.

## Example 2

Show that there are no point(s) of intersection between the line $x-y=5$ and the curve $y=x^{2}+5 x+1$.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
x-y=5 & \text { Substituting } y=(-5+x) \text { into } y=x^{2}+5 x+1 \\
\rightarrow-y=5-x & \text { we get }(-5+x)=x^{2}+5 x+1 \\
\rightarrow \quad y=(-5+x) & \therefore \quad 0=x^{2}+5 x+1+5-x \\
& 0=x^{2}+4 x+6
\end{array}
$$

If there are no points of intersection, this implies that $0=x^{2}+4 x+6$ has no real roots.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)<0 \\
& \quad 0=x^{2}+4 x+6 \rightarrow a=+1, b=+4, c=+6 . \\
& \quad \therefore \quad\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)=\left[4^{2}-4(1)(6)\right]=(16-24)=-8<0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore$ the line $x-y=5$ does not intersect the curve $y=x^{2}+5 x+1$.

## Exercise 2.3

$x+y-1=0$
5. $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$
$x+y=7$
6. $3 x^{2}-y^{2}=3$
$2 x-y=1$
7. $y=x^{2}-4 x+6$
$y=3 x-4$
8. $x^{2}+y^{2}-4 x+2=0$
$x+y-4=0$
9. $x^{2}+4 y^{2}=4$

10. $x y=4$
$2 x-y+2=0$
11. $y^{2}+x y=2$
$2 x+y=3$
12. $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 x-4 y+3=0$
$x-y+3=0$
13. $s=2 t-1$
$3 t^{2}-2 t s+s^{2}=9$
14. $2 s^{2}=t^{2}+1$
$2 s=t-3$
15. $2 t-3 s=1$
$t^{2}+t s-4 s^{2}=2$

## Section 2.4 Quadratic and linear equations in context -

Algebraic methods can be used to solve many real-life problems.
If we can represent an unknown or variable with a symbol, and write the relationship between the variables in the form of a linear or quadratic equation, then the resulting equations can be solved using the techniques discussed earlier.

## Example 1

A right-angled triangle is to be made from a rope 24 m long. If the hypotenuse of the triangle, AB , has to be 10 m , find
(i) an equation in terms of $x$ and $y$ for the perimeter of the triangle
(ii) an equation in terms of $x$ and $y$ for the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-065.jpg?height=276&width=395&top_left_y=937&top_left_x=1153) hypotenuse of the triangle.
(iii) Solve the equations to find possible
lengths of the base ( $x$ ) and height ( $y$ )
of the triangle.
(i) The perimeter of the triangle $=x+y+10$.
$\Rightarrow x+y+10=24 \Rightarrow x+y=14$.
(ii) The (hypotenuse) ${ }^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}=10^{2}$.
(iii) Since $x+y=14 \Rightarrow x=14-y$.
$\therefore(14-y)^{2}+y^{2}=10^{2}$
When $y=6$
$\therefore \quad 196-28 y+y^{2}+y^{2}=10^{2}$
$\Rightarrow x=14-y=14-6=8$.
$\therefore 2 y^{2}-28 y+96=0$
Also, if $y=8$
$\therefore \quad y^{2}-14 y+48=0$
$\Rightarrow x=14-y=14-8=6$.
$(y-6)(y-8)=0$
$\therefore \quad y=6$ or $y=8$
$\therefore$ if the base is 8 m , the height is 6 m , or vice versa.

## Example 2

A satellite is on a fact-finding mission to the moons of Pluto. The equation $x-y=3$ represents its path. A comet is discovered moving in a curve in the same plane as the satellite. If the path of the comet is determined to be $x^{2}+y^{2}-36 x+224=0$, decide if their paths will cross.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-066.jpg?height=407&width=663&top_left_y=268&top_left_x=885)

If the paths are to collide, then the intersection of the two equations must have real solution(s).
i.e. $b^{2}-4 a c \geqslant 0$.

If $x-y=3$,
then $y=x-3$. Substituting into $x^{2}+y^{2}-36 x+224=0$, we get $x^{2}+(x-3)^{2}-36 x+224=0$
$\therefore 2 x^{2}-42 x+233=0$... must have real solutions.
$\therefore \quad a=2, b=-42, c=233$.
$\therefore \quad b^{2}-4 a c=\left[(-42)^{2}-4(2)(233)\right]=-100<0$
$\therefore \quad$ There are no real solutions and the paths do not cross.

## Section 2.5 Forming quadratic equations from their roots

If we know the roots of an equation, we can find the equation by
(i) finding the factors of the equation
(ii) multiplying the factors to get the equation.

Generally, if we let $x=r_{1}$ and $x=r_{2}$ be the roots of a quadratic equation, then $\left(x-r_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x-r_{2}\right)$ are the factors and $\left(x-r_{1}\right)\left(x-r_{2}\right)=0$ is the equation.
i.e. $x^{2}-x r_{2}-x r_{1}+r_{1} r_{2}=0$
$x^{2}-x\left(r_{2}+r_{1}\right)+r_{1} r_{2}=0$.

Given $r_{1}, r_{2}$ as the roots of an equation, then the equation is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \quad x^{2}-x\left(r_{1}+r_{2}\right)+r_{1} r_{2}=0 \\
& \text { i.e. } x^{2}-x(\text { sum of the roots })+\text { product of the roots }=0 \text {. }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 1

Write the equation of a curve whose roots are 7 and -5 .
Since the equation has only two roots, it must be a quadratic equation.
$\therefore \quad x^{2}-x$ (sum of the roots) + product of the roots $=0$
$\therefore \quad x^{2}-x[7+(-5)]+[(7)(-5)]=0$ is the equation.
$\therefore \quad x^{2}-x(2)-35=0$
The equation is $x^{2}-2 x-35=0$.

## Example 2

If $x=\sqrt{3}$ and $x=\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}$ are the roots of a quadratic equation $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$, find possible values for $a, b$ and $c$.

We have that $x^{2}-x$ (sum of the roots) + product of the roots $=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow x^{2}-x\left(\sqrt{3}+\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)+\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)=0 \text { is the equation. } \\
& \Rightarrow x^{2}-x\left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)-\frac{3}{2}=0 \\
& \Rightarrow x^{2}-x\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)-\frac{3}{2}=0 \\
& 2 x^{2}-\sqrt{3} x-3=0 \ldots \text { multiplying both sides of the equation by } 2 \\
\therefore & a=2, b=-\sqrt{3} \text { and } c=-3
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: If $a=4, b=-2 \sqrt{3}$ and $c=-6$ we would have a different quadratic function but with the same roots.

## Exercise 2.5

1. State (i) the sum and (ii) the product of the roots of each of the following quadratic equations.

(d) $x^{2}-9 x-3=0$
(e) $2 x^{2}-7 x+1=0$
(f) $7 x^{2}+x-1=0$
(g) $3 x^{2}+10 x-2=0$
(h) $5 x^{2}+10 x+1=0$
(i) $3-2 x-x^{2}=0$
(j) $-5+3 x-4 x^{2}=0$
2. In the following table, you are given both the sum and the product of the roots of quadratic equations. In each case, find the quadratic equation in the form $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$, with $a, b$ and $c$ taking integer values.

| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Sum | -3 | 6 | 7 | $-\frac{2}{3}$ | $-\frac{5}{2}$ | $-\frac{3}{2}$ | $-\frac{1}{4}$ | $-1 \frac{2}{3}$ |
| Product | -1 | -4 | -5 | $-\frac{7}{3}$ | -2 | -5 | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ |

3. Find the quadratic equations that have the following pairs of roots $\left\{r_{1}, r_{2}\right\}$.
(i) $\{4,6\}$
(ii) $\{2,-3\}$
(iii) $\{-5,-1\}$
(iv) $\{\sqrt{5}, 4\}$
(v) $\{a, 3 a\}$
(vi) $\left\{\frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{5}\right\}$
(vii) $\left\{\frac{2}{b}, \frac{3}{b}\right\}$
(viii) $\left\{\frac{5}{2}, \frac{3}{5}\right\}$

## Section 2.6 Max and Min of Quadratic graphs

The quadratic expression $x^{2}-6 x+11$ can be rewritten as

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x^{2}-6 x+9-9+11 \\
= & (x-3)(x-3)-9+11=(x-3)^{2}+2 . \\
\therefore \quad x^{2}-6 x+11= & (x-3)^{2}+2 .
\end{aligned}
$$

This is called completing the square.
This form of a quadratic expression can give us very useful information about the behaviour of the quadratic function.
(i) Maximum or minimum values.

At $x=3,(x-3)=0$.
$\therefore(x-3)^{2}+2=2$ is the minimum value of this expression.
(ii) Real or complex roots.

Let $(x-3)^{2}+2=0$ to find the roots.
Then $(x-3)^{2}=-2$
$x-3= \pm \sqrt{-2}$
$x=3 \pm \sqrt{-2} \Rightarrow$ Complex roots.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-070.jpg?height=409&width=706&top_left_y=663&top_left_x=925)
(iii) Values of $\boldsymbol{x}$ which make the function positive or negative.
$(x-3)^{2}$ is positive for all $x \in R$.
$\therefore(x-3)^{2}+2$ is positive for all $x \in R$.
(iv) Each graph has a turning point which is the maximum or minimum point of the graph.
(v) Each graph has an axis of symmetry parallel to the $y$-axis through this point.
(vi) The graph of a quadratic function is called a parabola.

## Example 1

Complete the square on each of the following quadratic expressions.
Hence find the minimum value of each expression.
(i) $x^{2}-8 x+10$
(ii) $4 x^{2}+4 x+2$
(i) $x^{2}-8 x+10$
(ii) $4 x^{2}+4 x+2$
$=x^{2}-8 x+\mathbf{1 6 - 1 6 + 1 0}$
$=4\left(x^{2}+x+\frac{1}{2}\right)$
$=(x-4)(x-4)-6$
$=4\left(x^{2}+x+\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{4}}-\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{4}}+\frac{1}{2}\right)$
$=(x-4)^{2}-6$
Minimum value $=-6$
$=4\left[\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}+\frac{1}{4}\right]$
$=4\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}+1$
Minimum value $=+1$

Generally, to complete the square of expressions of the form $x^{2}+\mathrm{b} x+\mathrm{c}$, add and subtract (half the coefficient of $\boldsymbol{x})^{\mathbf{2}}$ to the expression

$$
x^{2}+b x+c=\left(x+\frac{b}{2}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^{2}+c
$$ and isolate the perfect square portion.

$$
\text { i.e. } x^{2}+b x+c=x^{2}+b x+\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^{2}+c=\left(x+\frac{b}{2}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^{2}+c
$$

Note: If the coefficient of $x^{2}$ is not 1 , the $x^{2}$ coefficient must be factored out before proceeding, e.g.,
(i) $x^{2}+2 x+5=x^{2}+2 x+\mathbf{1}-\mathbf{1}+5$

$$
=(x+1)^{2}+4
$$

(ii) $4-2 x-x^{2}=4-\left(x^{2}+2 x\right)=4-\left(x^{2}+2 x+\mathbf{1}-\mathbf{1}\right)=4-\left[(x+1)^{2}-1\right]$

$$
=5-(x+1)^{2}
$$

(iii) $3 x^{2}-3 x+2=3\left(x^{2}-x+\frac{2}{3}\right)=3\left(x^{2}-x+\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{2}{3}\right)$

$$
=3\left[\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}+\frac{5}{12}\right]=3\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}+\frac{5}{4}
$$

All quadratic expressions $\left(a x^{2}+b x+c\right)$ can be written in the form of

$$
a(x-p)^{2}+q, \underset{\text { graph }}{a \cup \text {-shaped }}
$$ or $q-a(x-p)^{2}$, a $\cap$-shaped graph.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-071.jpg?height=664&width=970&top_left_y=1054&top_left_x=661)

ICT: Using a graphics calculator or computer software (e.g. Geogebra), sketches of the following curves can be compared, identifying the minimum points and the axes of symmetry for each.

|  | Min |
| :--- | :---: |
| $f(x)=x^{2}=(x-0)^{2}+0$ | $(0,0)$ |
| $g(x)=x^{2}-6 x+9=(x-3)^{2}+0$ | $(3,0)$ |
| $h(x)=x^{2}-6 x+11=(x-3)^{2}+2$ | $(3,2)$ |
| $p(x)=3 x^{2}-18 x+26=3(x-3)^{2}-1$ | $(3,-1)$ |

The point ( $p, q$ ) is the minimum point of the curve $a(x-p)^{2}+q$.
At $x=p,(x-p)=0$.
$\Rightarrow a(x-p)^{2}+q=0+q=q$, the minimum value.
Similarly, a quadratic equation in the form $q-a(x-p)^{2}$ has a maximum point at ( $p, q$ ) and a maximum value $q$ at the point $x=p$.

When quadratic expressions can be written as $a(x-p)^{2}+q$, there is a minimum point $(p, q)$. When quadratic expressions can be written as $q-a(x-p)^{2}$, there is a maximum point $(p, q)$.

## Example 2

Write the quadratic equation $x^{2}+4 x+1$ in the form $(x-p)^{2}+q$ and hence,
(i) find the minimum point and minimum value of $x^{2}+4 x+1$
(ii) solve the equation $x^{2}+4 x+1=0$, leaving your answer in surd form.
(i) $x^{2}+4 x+1=x^{2}+4 x+4-4+1$

$$
=(x+2)^{2}-3
$$

$\Rightarrow$ the minimum point is $(-2,-3)$
$\Rightarrow$ the minimum value of the expression is -3 .
(ii) Solving $x^{2}+4 x+1=0$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow(x+2)^{2}-3=0 \\
& \Rightarrow(x+2)^{2}=3 \\
& \Rightarrow x+2= \pm \sqrt{3} \\
& \Rightarrow x=-2 \pm \sqrt{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

(Note: It should be verified that the same result is obtained using the quadratic formula.)

## Example 3

(i) Write the equation of the graph provided in the form $y=q-a(x-p)^{2}$, where ( $p, q$ ) is the maximum point of the curve and $a$ is a constant.
(ii) By choosing any suitable point on the curve, find $a$.
(iii) Hence write the equation in the form $y=a x^{2}+b x+c$.
(i) The maximum point $=(-1,3)=(p, q)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\quad y & =q-a(x-p)^{2} \\
\therefore \quad y & =3-a(x+1)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) Selecting $(x, y)=(1,1)$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow 1 & =3-a(1+1)^{2} \\
& =3-4 a \\
\Rightarrow a & =\frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

(iii) $\therefore \quad y=3-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(x+1)^{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad y & =3-\frac{x^{2}}{2}-x-\frac{1}{2} \\
& =-\frac{x^{2}}{2}-x+2 \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 2.7 Surds

A surd is a square root which cannot be reduced to a whole number, e.g. $\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{6}, \sqrt{7}, \ldots$
If $x^{2}=2$, then $x=\sqrt{2}=1.414213562 \ldots$ A surd is therefore an irrational number, a number which cannot be expressed as a fraction.

## Remember:

The $\sqrt{x}$, where $x \geqslant 0$, is the non-negative square root of $x$. e.g. $\sqrt{25}=5$.
$\sqrt{1}, \sqrt{9}, \sqrt{\frac{25}{16}} \ldots$ are not surds since $1,9, \frac{25}{16}$ etc., are perfect squares and have square roots.

Note: $x=\sqrt{2}$ is an exact answer.
$x=1.414213562 \ldots$ is an approximate or corrected answer and should be only given when asked for.

## 1. Reducing surds to their lowest form

$\sqrt{5}, \sqrt{6}, \sqrt{7}$ cannot be simplified further, but $\sqrt{8}=\sqrt{4 \times 2}=\sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{2}=2 \sqrt{2}$, since 8 has a factor that is a perfect square.

## 2. Simplifying surd quotients

$\sqrt{\frac{50}{64}}=\frac{\sqrt{50}}{\sqrt{64}}=\frac{\sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{2}}{8}=\frac{5 \sqrt{2}}{8}$

## 3. Adding or subtracting surds

$2 \sqrt{3}+4 \sqrt{3}=6 \sqrt{3}$.
$\sqrt{27}-\sqrt{12}=\sqrt{9 \times 3}-\sqrt{4 \times 3}=3 \sqrt{3}-2 \sqrt{3}=\sqrt{3}$.

$$
\sqrt{a b}=\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}
$$

$$
\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}=\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}
$$

## 4. Multiplying surds

$\sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{4}=(\sqrt{4})^{2}=4$.

$$
\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}=\sqrt{a b}
$$

$\sqrt{5} \times \sqrt{6}=\sqrt{30}$.
$(7-\sqrt{2})(7+\sqrt{2})=49+7 \sqrt{2}-7 \sqrt{2}-2=47$.

$$
a \sqrt{b} \pm c \sqrt{b}=(a \pm c) \sqrt{b}
$$

## 5. Dividing by surds

It is normal practice not to leave a surd (an irrational number) in the denominator of a quotient, hence the practice of "rationalising the denominator".
$\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}=\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}=\frac{5 \sqrt{3}}{3}$ (Note: Multiplying by $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}$ is equivalent to multiplying by 1.)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{7-\sqrt{2}} & =\frac{1}{7-\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{7+\sqrt{2}}{7+\sqrt{2}} \\
& =\frac{7+\sqrt{2}}{7^{2}-\sqrt{2^{2}}}=\frac{7+\sqrt{2}}{47}
\end{aligned}
$$

To rationalise the denominator:

$$
\frac{1}{a-\sqrt{b}}=\frac{1}{a-\sqrt{b}} \cdot \frac{a+\sqrt{b}}{a+\sqrt{b}}
$$

## Example 1

(i) Express $\sqrt{80}$ in the form $a \sqrt{5}$, where $a$ is an integer.
(ii) Express $(4-\sqrt{5})^{2}$ in the form $b+c \sqrt{5}$, where $b$ and $c$ are integers.
(i) $\sqrt{80}=\sqrt{16 \times 5}=4 \sqrt{5}$
(ii) $(4-\sqrt{5})^{2}=(4-\sqrt{5})(4-\sqrt{5})=16-8 \sqrt{5}+5=21-8 \sqrt{5}$

## Example 2

Simplify
(i) $\frac{\sqrt{12}}{5 \sqrt{3}-\sqrt{27}}$
(ii) $\frac{7}{\sqrt{13}-\sqrt{11}}$
(i) $\frac{\sqrt{12}}{5 \sqrt{3}-\sqrt{27}}=\frac{\sqrt{4 \times 3}}{5 \sqrt{3}-\sqrt{9 \times 3}}=\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{5 \sqrt{3}-3 \sqrt{3}}=\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{2 \sqrt{3}}=1$
(ii) $\frac{7}{\sqrt{13}-\sqrt{11}}=\frac{7}{\sqrt{13}-\sqrt{11}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{13}+\sqrt{11}}{\sqrt{13}+\sqrt{11}}=\frac{7(\sqrt{13}+\sqrt{11})}{13-11}=\frac{7(\sqrt{13}+\sqrt{11})}{2}$

## Section 2.8 Algebraic surd equations

Expressions such as $\sqrt{2 x+1}$ occur often in algebra.
To solve the equation $\sqrt{2 x+1}=5$, we proceed as follows.

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\sqrt{2 x+1})^{2} & =5^{2} \ldots \text { squaring both sides to remove the square root } \\
2 x+1 & =25 \\
2 x & =24 \\
\Rightarrow \quad x & =12
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: With surds, it is important to check all solutions in the original equation as some may result in complex (non-real) solutions.

At $x=12, \sqrt{2 x+1}=\sqrt{2.12+1}=\sqrt{25}=5$, which is correct.

## Example 1

Solve $x=\sqrt{x+6}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x=\sqrt{x+6} \\
& \therefore \quad x^{2}=x+6 \ldots \text { (squaring both sides) } \\
& \therefore \quad x^{2}-x-6=0 \\
& \therefore \quad(x-3)(x+2)=0 \\
& \therefore \quad x=3 \text { or } x=-2
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-079.jpg?height=312&width=606&top_left_y=238&top_left_x=291)

Validating both solutions (in original equation) we find
(i) at $x=3: \quad 3=\sqrt{3+6}=3$ (True)
(ii) at $x=-2: \quad-2=\sqrt{-2+6}=2$ (False)

Note: If we look at these curves graphically we can see why there is only one valid solution.

- If there is only one surd, isolate it on one side and then square both sides and solve.
- If there are two surds, move one to each side of the equation. Square both sides and isolate any remaining surds. Square both sides again to remove any remaining surd.
- Solve the resulting equation.
- Check your answers in the original equation.


## Example 2

Solve $\sqrt{5 x+6}-\sqrt{2 x}=2$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{5 x+6}-\sqrt{2 x} & =2 \\
\sqrt{5 x+6} & =\sqrt{2 x}+2 \quad \ldots \text { place one surd on each side } \\
(\sqrt{5 x+6})^{2} & =(\sqrt{2 x}+2)^{2} \quad \ldots \text { square both sides } \\
5 x+6 & =2 x+4 \sqrt{2 x}+4 \\
3 x+2 & =4 \sqrt{2 x} \quad \ldots \text { isolate the surd on one side of the equation } \\
(3 x+2)^{2} & =(4 \sqrt{2 x})^{2} \quad \ldots \text { square both sides again } \\
9 x^{2}+12 x+4 & =(16) 2 x \\
9 x^{2}-20 x+4 & =0 \\
(9 x-2)(x-2) & =0 \\
\therefore \quad x=2 \text { or } x & =\frac{2}{9}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: It is important to check the validity of both solutions in the original equation
i.e. (i) at $x=2: \sqrt{5(2)+6}-\sqrt{2(2)}=4-2=2$ (True)
(ii) at $x=\frac{2}{9}: \sqrt{5\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)+6}-\sqrt{2\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{64}{9}\right)}-\sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{9}\right)}=\frac{8}{3}-\frac{2}{3}=2$ (True)

If $\mid$ ID $\mid=\sqrt{56}$, find $x$.

## Section 2.9 The factor theorem

In Chapter 1 we revised techniques for factorising algebraic expressions.
The factor theorem is a more general technique that can be applied to expressions of higher orders.
Using long division, we can divide $f(x)=x^{3}+3 x^{2}-4 x-12$ by $x+3$ as before.

\$\$

\$\$

Evaluating the function at $x=-3,+2,-2$;

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(-3) & =(-3)^{3}+3(-3)^{2}-4(-3)-12=0 \\
f(-2) & =(-2)^{3}+3(-2)^{2}-4(-2)-12=0 \\
f(2) & =(2)^{3}+3(2)^{2}-4(2)-12=0, \text { as we would expect of every root. }
\end{aligned}
$$

Generalising this for every polynomial $f(x)$; if $f(k)=0$, then $x-k$ is a factor.
Conversely, if $x-k$ is a factor, then $f(k)=0$.

## The Factor Theorem:

If $f(k)=0$, then $(x-k)$ is a factor.
Conversely, if $(x-k)$ is a factor, then $f(k)=0$.
Also, if $(a x-k)$ is a factor, then $f\left(\frac{k}{a}\right)=0$.

## Example 1

Show that $(2 x-3)$ is a factor of $2 x^{3}-5 x^{2}+5 x-3$.
Given $(2 x-3)$ is a factor, then $(2 x-3)=0$ is a root, i.e. $x=\frac{3}{2}$ is a root. If $(2 x-3)$ is a factor, then $f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)$ must equal 0 .

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(x)=2 x^{3}-5 x^{2}+5 x-3 \\
& f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)=2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{3}-5\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{2}+5\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)+3=\left(\frac{27}{4}\right)-\left(\frac{45}{4}\right)+\left(\frac{15}{2}\right)-3=0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad(2 x-3)$ is a factor of $f(x)=2 x^{3}-5 x^{2}+5 x-3$.

## Example 2

If $(x-2)$ and $(x+1)$ are both factors of $a x^{3}+3 x^{2}-9 x+b$, find the values $a$ and $b$.

If $(x-2)$ is a factor, then $f(2)=0$.
If $(x+1)$ is a factor, then $f(-1)=0$.
(i) $f(2)=a(2)^{3}+3(2)^{2}-9(2)+b=0$
(ii) $f(-1)=a(-1)^{3}+3(-1)^{2}-9(-1)+b=0$
$\Rightarrow a .8+3.4-18+b=0$
$\Rightarrow a(-1)+3.1+9+b=0$
$\Rightarrow 8 a+12-18+b=0$
$\Rightarrow-a+3+9+b=0$
$\Rightarrow 8 a+b=6$
$\Rightarrow-a+b=-12$
Using simultaneous equations,
$\Rightarrow a-b=12$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow 8 a+b & =6 \\
a-b & =12 \\
\hline 9 a & =18 \\
a & =2
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\therefore \quad a=2 \text { and } b=-10 \text {. }
$$

## 1. Factorising cubic expressions

We can now use the factor theorem to factorise higher-order polynomials, e.g. cubic polynomials of the form $f(x)=a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d$ that have at least one integer root.

Using trial and error, we evaluate $f(0), f(1), f(-1), f(2), f(-2), f(3) \ldots$ etc., until we get a value of zero.
This is the integer root.
If $f(-2)=0$, then $(x+2)$ is a factor.
If $f(3)=0$, then $(x-3)$ is a factor.
Dividing by this factor produces a quadratic expression which can be factorised separately using factor pairs or using the quadratic formula.

## Example 3

Factorise $f(x)=2 x^{3}+x^{2}-13 x+6$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(x)=2 x^{3}+x^{2}-13 x+6 \\
& f(0)=0+0-0+6=6 \neq 0 \\
& f(1)=2(1)^{3}+(1)^{2}-13(1)+6=-4 \neq 0 \\
& f(-1)=2(-1)^{3}+(-1)^{2}-13(-1)+6 \\
& \quad=+18 \neq 0 \\
& f(2)=2(2)^{3}+(2)^{2}-13(2)+6=0 \\
& \therefore \quad(x-2) \text { is a factor. }
\end{aligned}
$$

Dividing $2 x^{3}+x^{2}-13 x+6$ by ( $x-2$ ),

$$
\begin{array}{r}
x - 2 \longdiv { 2 x ^ { 2 } + 5 x - 3 } \\
\frac{2 x^{3}+x^{2}-13 x+6}{5 x^{2}}-13 x+6 \\
\frac{5 x^{2}-10 x}{-3 x+6} \\
\frac{-3 x+6}{0+0}
\end{array}
$$

$\Rightarrow$ the factors of $f(x)$ are $(x-2)\left(2 x^{2}+5 x-3\right)$
$\Rightarrow$ the factors of $f(x)$ are $(x-2)(x+3)(2 x-1)$.

## 2. Solving cubic equations

To solve cubic equations of the form $f(x)=a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d=0$, we first find the factors as in the above example and then equate each factor to zero to find the roots(solutions).

## Example 4

Solve the equation $\quad 2 x^{3}-4 x^{2}-22 x+24=0$.

Let $f(x)=2 x^{3}-4 x^{2}-22 x+24$
$\Rightarrow f(0)=2(0)^{3}-4(0)^{2}-22(0)+24=24$
$\Rightarrow f(1)=2(1)^{3}-4(1)^{2}-22(1)+24=0$
$\Rightarrow(x-1)$ is a factor.
The factors are $(x-1)\left(2 x^{2}-2 x-24\right)$
Factorising further ; $(x-1)(2 x+6)(x-4)$
$\therefore f(x)=0 \Rightarrow(x-1)=0 \Rightarrow x=1$.

Dividing we get,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 x^{2}-2 x-24 \\
x-1 & \longdiv { 2 x ^ { 3 } - 4 x ^ { 2 } - 2 2 x + 2 4 } \\
& \frac{2 x^{3}-2 x^{2}}{-2 x^{2}}-22 x+24 \\
& \frac{-2 x^{2}+2 x}{-24 x+24} \\
& \underline{-24 x+24}
\end{aligned}
$$

Also, $(2 x+6)=0 \Rightarrow x=-3$
and $(x-4)=0 \Rightarrow x=4$.
The solutions are $\{1,-3,4\}$

## Section 2.10 Graphs of cubic (and higher order) polynomials

The coefficients of a cubic polynomial $f(x)=a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d$ determine the final shape of each graph. Some important features need to be noted and emphasised.

ICT: Input each of the following functions using a graphics calculator or computer software (e.g. Geogebra). Examine the effect of changing coefficients on the shape of each graph.

Note: The factor form of each function is very suitable in some cases.

1. Three real roots
$f(x)=2 x^{3}-4 x^{2}-22 x+24$
$f(x)=(x-1)(2 x+6)(x-4)$
This graph has three real roots, $-3,1,4$.

As the graph passes through a root, the value of the function changes from
$(-)^{\mathrm{ve}}$ to $(+)^{\mathrm{ve}}$ or $(+)^{\mathrm{ve}}$ to $(-)^{\mathrm{ve}}$.
The graph has two turning points, a local maximum and a local minimum.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-086.jpg?height=550&width=776&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=852)

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) & =2 x^{3}-4 x^{2}-22 x+24 \\
& =(2 x+6)(x-1)(x-4)
\end{aligned}
$$

2. Three real roots, two of which repeat

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) & =x^{3}-x^{2}-8 x+12 \\
& =(x+3)(x-2)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

This graph again has three real roots, $-3,2,2$, but one of the roots is repeated.
This graph only crosses the $x$-axis once because of the repeated root.
The graph has two turning points.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-086.jpg?height=553&width=508&top_left_y=992&top_left_x=1118)

$$
\begin{array}{r}
f(x)=x^{3}-x^{2}-8 x+12 \\
=(x+3)(x-2)(x-2) \\
=(x+3)(x-2)^{2}
\end{array}
$$

3. One real, two non-real roots

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) & =x^{3}-2 x-4 \\
& =(x-2)\left(x^{2}+2 x+2\right) \\
& =(x-2)(x+1-\sqrt{-1})(x+1+\sqrt{-1}) \quad \ldots \text { using the } \\
& \quad \text { quadratic formula }
\end{aligned}
$$

This polynomial has only one real root but two non-real (complex) roots.

It crosses the $x$ - axis once and has two turning points.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-086.jpg?height=406&width=357&top_left_y=1723&top_left_x=1278)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(x)=x^{3}-2 x-4 \\
& \quad=(x-2)\left(x^{2}+2 x+2\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

4. Comparing $f(x)=x^{3}-3 x^{2}+2 x$ and $g(x)=2 x^{3}-6 x^{2}+4 x=2 f(x)$

Both polynomials have the same roots, $x=0,1,2$. $\therefore$ the polynomials have common factors ( $x$ ), $(x-1)$ and $(x-2)$.
But $g(x)$ has an integer factor 2 as well that multiplies each value of the curve, except where the value is zero at the roots.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-087.jpg?height=508&width=943&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=686)

This integer factor acts as an amplification factor.
5. Comparing $f(x)=x^{3}-3 x^{2}+2 x$ and $g(x)=-x^{3}+3 x^{2}-2 x=-f(x)$

Again, both polynomials have the same roots and hence common factors. The graphs are symmetrical across the $x$-axis.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-087.jpg?height=508&width=995&top_left_y=939&top_left_x=634)
$g(x)=-x^{3}+3 x^{2}-2 x=-\left(x^{3}-3 x^{2}+2 x\right)=-f(x)$.
Multiplying by a minus inverts the graph.
6. The graphs of $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{3}}$

All the graphs pass through $(0,0)$.
For $a>0$, the graphs are all increasing, and as $a$ increases, the graphs rise more steeply. For $a<0$, the graphs are decreasing.
Note:
(i) If $f(x)=3 x^{3}$ and $g(x)=-3 x^{3}$, $\Rightarrow f(x)=-g(x)$, i.e. $f(x)$ is the reflection of $g(x)$ in the $x$-axis.
(ii) $f(-x)=g(x)$, i.e. $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ reflect each other in the $y$-axis.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-087.jpg?height=574&width=512&top_left_y=1653&top_left_x=1116)

Note: There are no local maximum or minimum points as in the previous graphs.

## Summary:

(i) Every cubic polynomial crosses the $x$-axis at least once, i.e has one real root.
(ii) Each root produces a factor of the polynomial.
(iii) If a polynomial has a repeated root with an even power e.g. $(x-2)^{2},(x-3)^{4}$ etc., then the graph touches, but does cross, the $x$-axis at these points.
(iv) If the coefficient of $x^{3}$ is positive, the graph starts below the $x$-axis, i.e. starts with a negative $y$-value and increases with increasing $x$-values.
(v) If the coefficient of $x^{3}$ is negative, the graph starts above the $x$-axis, i.e. starts with a positive $y$-value and decreases with increasing $x$-values.
(vi) Some cubic graphs have local maximum and minimum turning points.
(vii) When forming a polynomial from its roots, check for an integer factor.

## Example 1

By examining the graph, find an expression for this cubic polynomial.
(i) The graph crosses the $x$-axis at $x=-2$.
(ii) $\Rightarrow x=-2$ is a root $\Rightarrow(x+2)$ is a factor.
(iii) The graph touches the $x$-axis at $x=1$.
$\Rightarrow x=1$ is a repeated root
$\Rightarrow(x-1)^{2}$ is a factor.
(iv) The graph may contain an integer factor, i.e. $f(x)=a(x+2)(x-1)^{2}$.

From the sketch of this graph,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-088.jpg?height=557&width=604&top_left_y=1162&top_left_x=938) when $x=0, f(x)=4$.
$\therefore \quad 4=a(2)(1)^{2}=2 a$
$\therefore \quad a=2$.
$\therefore f(x)=2(x+2)(x-1)^{2}=2 x^{3}-6 x+4$.

## 7. Higher-order polynomials

## Example 2

The graph of the polynomial $f(x)=a(x+b)(x+c)(x+d)(x+d)$ is given in the diagram. Find the values of $a, b, c$ and $d$.

From the diagram, the roots are $x=-2,-1,3$.
A double root occurs at $x=3$.
Hence the factors are $(x+2),(x+1),(x-3)$ and ( $x-3$ ).
$\therefore f(x)=a(x+2)(x+1)(x-3)(x-3)$.
At $x=0, f(x)=18$.
$\therefore \quad 18=a(0+2)(0+1)(0-3)(0-3)=18 a$
$\therefore a=1$
$\therefore \quad a=1, b=2, c=1, d=-3$.

## Section 3.1 Radian measure

In your study of geometry and trigonometry so far, you will have worked with angles which were measured in degrees. One complete revolution is $360^{\circ}$. However, in more advanced trigonometry and calculus, angles are almost always measured in radians.

The diagram on the right shows an arc AB equal in length to the radius, $r$.

The measure of $\angle \mathrm{AOB}$ is said to be 1 radian.
If the length of the arc AB was $2 r$, then $|\angle \mathrm{AOB}|$ would be 2 radians.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-100.jpg?height=320&width=343&top_left_y=1014&top_left_x=1290)

Radian
A radian is the measure of the angle at the centre of a circle subtended by an arc equal in length to the radius.

Since the circumference of a circle is $2 \pi r$, i.e., $2 \pi$ times the radius, then there are $2 \pi$ radians in one complete revolution.

$$
\begin{array}{rr}
\Rightarrow & 2 \pi \text { radians }=360^{\circ} \\
\Rightarrow & \pi \text { radians }=180^{\circ}
\end{array}
$$

Frequently used angles are given in degrees and radians in the box below:

| Degrees | $0^{\circ}$ | $30^{\circ}$ | $45^{\circ}$ | $60^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ | $180^{\circ}$ | $270^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Radians | 0 | $\frac{\pi}{6}$ | $\frac{\pi}{4}$ | $\frac{\pi}{3}$ | $\frac{\pi}{2}$ | $\pi$ | $\frac{3 \pi}{2}$ | $2 \pi$ |

Since $\pi$ radians $=180^{\circ} \Rightarrow 1$ radian $=\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}=57.3^{\circ}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-100.jpg?height=308&width=333&top_left_y=1819&top_left_x=1300)

## Length of arc - Area of sector

If $l$ is the length of an arc of a circle of radius $r$, then the angle $\theta$ at the centre of the circle is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta \text { radians } & =\frac{l}{r} \\
\Rightarrow \quad l & =r \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-101.jpg?height=324&width=350&top_left_y=168&top_left_x=1287)

Also since area of the circle is $\pi r^{2}$, the area of the sector AOB is

$$
\text { Area }=\frac{\theta}{2 \pi} \times \pi r^{2} \Rightarrow \text { Area }=\frac{\theta r^{2}}{2}=\frac{1}{2} r^{2} \theta
$$

Arc length $l=r \theta$
Area of sector $=\frac{1}{2} r^{2} \theta$

## Example 1

Express (i) $\frac{2 \pi}{5}$ radians in degrees
(ii) $210^{\circ}$ in radians.
(i) $\frac{2 \pi}{5}$ radians $=\frac{2 \times 180^{\circ}}{5}=\frac{360^{\circ}}{5}=72^{\circ}$
(ii) $210^{\circ}$ to radians

$$
\begin{aligned}
180^{\circ} & =\pi \text { radians } \\
\Rightarrow \quad 1^{\circ} & =\frac{\pi}{180} \text { radians } \\
\Rightarrow \quad 210^{\circ} & =\frac{\pi}{180} \times \frac{210}{1} \text { radians } \\
& =\frac{21 \pi}{18} \\
& =\frac{7 \pi}{6} \text { radians }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

The radius of a circle is 8 cm . Find
(i) the angle at the centre of the circle subtended by an arc of length 10 cm
(ii) the length of the arc if the angle subtended at the centre of the circle is $\frac{\pi}{4}$.
(i) Length of $\operatorname{arc} l=r \theta \Rightarrow \theta=\frac{l}{r}=\frac{10}{8} \Rightarrow \theta=\frac{5}{4}$ radians.
(ii) Length of $\operatorname{arc}=r \theta$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =8 \times \frac{\pi}{4} \\
& =2 \pi \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 3.2 Trigonometric ratios

In your study of trigonometry so far you will have used the theorem of Pythagoras and trigonometric ratios to find the missing sides or angles of a right-angled triangle.
The three basic trigonometric ratios are given below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sin A=\frac{\text { opposite side }}{\text { hypotenuse }} \\
& \cos A=\frac{\text { adjacent side }}{\text { hypotenuse }} \\
& \tan A=\frac{\text { opposite side }}{\text { adjacent side }}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 1

If $\tan B=\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$, find the value of $\sin B$ and $\cos B$.
$\tan B=\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} \Rightarrow$ opposite side to $B$ is $\sqrt{5}$ and adjacent side is 2 .
Now draw a rough sketch of a right-angled triangle.
Let $x$ be the length of the hypotenuse.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x^{2}=2^{2}+(\sqrt{5})^{2} \ldots(\sqrt{5})^{2}=5 \\
& x^{2}=4+5 \\
& x^{2}=9 \Rightarrow x=3
\end{aligned}
$$

From the triangle: $\sin B=\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3} \quad$ and $\quad \cos B=\frac{2}{3}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-104.jpg?height=300&width=327&top_left_y=463&top_left_x=1152)

## Using a calculator

We use the sin, cos and tan keys on an electronic calculator to find the sine, cosine and tangent of any angle.
To find $\sin 35^{\circ}$, key in $\sin 35=$.
The result is $0.573576 \ldots=0.5736$, correct to 4 decimal places.

## Parts of a degree

A degree can be divided into 60 parts.

$$
1^{\circ}=60^{\prime}
$$

Each part is called 1 minute, written $1^{\prime}$.
Thus $34.5^{\circ}=34^{\circ} 30^{\prime}$.
To find $\tan 34.5^{\circ}$ or $34^{\circ} 30^{\prime}$ on your calculator, you may use either of these methods:

1. For $\tan 34.5^{\circ}$
key in $\tan 34.5=$
Result $=0.6873$
2. For $\tan 34^{\circ} 30^{\prime}$
key in tan $3 4 \longdiv { \circ },,, 30 \quad \circ \quad \circ$
Result $=0.6873$

## Using the $\sin ^{-1} \cos ^{-1}$ and $\tan ^{-1}$ keys

If we are given that $\sin A=0.8661$, we can find the angle $A$ by using the $\sin ^{-1} \mathrm{key}$.
The $\sin ^{-1}$ key is got by keying in SHIFT sin.
Thus if $\sin A=0.8661$, we find $A$ by keying in SHIFT sin $0.8661=$.
The result is $60.008^{\circ}=60^{\circ}$.
Similarly, if $\tan B=1.2734$, we find the angle $B$ by keying in SHIFT $\tan 1.2734=$.
The result is $51.86^{\circ} \ldots$ correct to 2 decimal places.

## Example 2

(i) Find $\cos 72^{\circ} 18^{\prime}$, correct to 4 decimal places.
(ii) If $\sin A=0.5216$, find $A$ correct to the nearest degree.
(i) To find $\cos 72^{\circ} 18^{\prime}$, key in $\cos 72{ }^{\circ},,, 18{ }^{\circ},,,=$ The result is 0.3040 . Notice that the $\square$ ${ }^{\circ}$,,, key is used twice.

$$
\text { Or } 18^{\prime}=\frac{18^{\circ}}{60}=0.3^{\circ} \Rightarrow 72^{\circ} 18^{\prime}=72.3^{\circ}
$$

$$
\text { Thus to find } 72.3^{\circ} \text {, key in } \cos 72.3=
$$

(ii) If $\sin A=0.5216$, we find $A$ by keying in

$$
\text { SHIFT } \sin 0.5216=
$$

The result is $31.44^{\circ} . \Rightarrow A=31^{\circ}$, to the nearest degree.

Note: If you are given $\sin A=\frac{4}{7}$, you can find the angle $A$ by keying in

$$
\text { SHIFT } \sin (1) 4 \times 1)=
$$

The result is $34.8^{\circ}$.

## The angles $\mathbf{3 0}^{\boldsymbol{\circ}}, \mathbf{4 5}^{\boldsymbol{\circ}}$ and $\mathbf{6 0}^{\boldsymbol{\circ}}$

The angles $30^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}$ and $60^{\circ}$ are used very frequently and we will use triangles to express the sine, cosine and tangent ratios of these angles as fractions or surds.
The triangle on the right is isosceles where the equal sides are 1 unit in length.
The hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$ units in length.
The sine, cosine and tangent ratios can be read from the triangle.

$$
\sin 45^{\circ}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \quad \cos 45^{\circ}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \quad \tan 45^{\circ}=1
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-105.jpg?height=357&width=350&top_left_y=1399&top_left_x=1284)

The given right-angled triangle has angles of $60^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$.
We can use this triangle to write down the trigonometric ratios of these two angles.

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\sin 60^{\circ}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & \cos 60^{\circ}=\frac{1}{2} & \tan 60^{\circ}=\sqrt{3} \\
\sin 30^{\circ}=\frac{1}{2} & \cos 30^{\circ}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & \tan 30^{\circ}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\end{array}
$$

Note: The sine, cosine and tangent ratios for $30^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}$ and $60^{\circ}$ are given on page 13 of Formulae and Tables.

## Section 3.3 Trigonometric functions

In this section we will deal with angles from $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ and show how to find the sine, cosine or tangent of these angles.
Angles are measured from the positive $x$-axis.
Positive angles are measured in an anti-clockwise direction.
Negative angles are measured in a clockwise direction.
The diagrams below illustrate two positive and two negative angles.

## 1. The Unit Circle

The circle on the right has centre at $(0,0)$ and radius 1 unit in length. It is generally referred to as the unit circle.
Let $\mathrm{P}(x, y)$ be any point on the circle, as shown.
From the triangle OPC,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{x}{1}=\cos \theta & & x=\frac{y}{1}=\sin \theta \\
\Rightarrow \quad & x=\cos \theta & & \Rightarrow y=\sin \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad$ the coordinates of P are $(\boldsymbol{\operatorname { c o s }} \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }} \boldsymbol{\theta})$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-107.jpg?height=343&width=386&top_left_y=1073&top_left_x=1132)

The coordinates of any point on the unit circle are $(\boldsymbol{\operatorname { c o s }} \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }} \boldsymbol{\theta})$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-107.jpg?height=343&width=499&top_left_y=1460&top_left_x=1132)

## 2. The Four Quadrants

The $x$-axis and $y$-axis divide a full rotation of $360^{\circ}$ into 4 quadrants, as shown on the right.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-107.jpg?height=411&width=470&top_left_y=1848&top_left_x=755)

The unit circle on the right shows an angle, $\theta$, in each of the four quadrants. The signs shown in each triangle determine whether a ratio is positive or negative.

The positive ratios in the four quadrants are shown in the highlighted section below.
(i) In the 1st quadrant, all (A) positive
(ii) In the 2nd quadrant, $\sin (\mathrm{S})$ only positive
(iii) In the 3rd quadrant,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-108.jpg?height=229&width=232&top_left_y=555&top_left_x=742) tan(T) only positive
(iv) In the 4 th quadrant, $\cos (\mathrm{C})$ only positive

The reference angle, of any angle A , is always the smallest (acute) angle to the horizontal $x$-axis.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-108.jpg?height=963&width=606&top_left_y=173&top_left_x=1026)

## Example 1

Find in surd form
(i) $\sin 120^{\circ}$
(ii) $\cos 225^{\circ}$
(i) $\sin 120^{\circ}$ :
$120^{\circ}$ is in the second quadrant
$\Rightarrow$ the sine ratio is positive
The reference angle is $180^{\circ}-120^{\circ}=60^{\circ}$.
Using page 13 of Formulae and Tables,
$\sin 60^{\circ}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \Rightarrow \sin 120^{\circ}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-108.jpg?height=343&width=350&top_left_y=1370&top_left_x=1133)
(ii) $\cos 225^{\circ}$ :
$225^{\circ}$ is in the third quadrant
$\Rightarrow$ the cosine ratio is negative
The reference angle is $225^{\circ}-180^{\circ}=45^{\circ}$.
$\cos 45^{\circ}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Rightarrow \cos 225^{\circ}=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-108.jpg?height=343&width=362&top_left_y=1738&top_left_x=1120)

## Example 2

(i) Express in surd form, $\cos \left(-135^{\circ}\right)$.
(ii) If $\sin x=-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, find two values for $x$ if $0^{\circ} \leqslant x \leqslant 360^{\circ}$.
(i) $\cos \left(-135^{\circ}\right)=\cos 45^{\circ}$ in the 3rd quadrant

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =-\cos 45^{\circ} \ldots \text { cosine negative in 3rd quadrant } \\
& =-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-109.jpg?height=402&width=402&top_left_y=386&top_left_x=1176)
(ii) $\sin x=-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
$\Rightarrow x=60^{\circ}$ in the 3 rd or 4th quadrants
$\Rightarrow x=\left(180^{\circ}+60^{\circ}\right)$ or $x=\left(360^{\circ}-60^{\circ}\right)$
$\Rightarrow x=240^{\circ}$ or $x=300^{\circ}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-109.jpg?height=394&width=399&top_left_y=812&top_left_x=1177)

The diagram on the right shows an acute angle $\theta$ in each of the four quadrants.
CAST shows the positive ratios in these quadrants.
The diagram shows that $\sin \left(180^{\circ}+\theta\right)=-\sin \theta$ as the sine is negative in the 3rd quadrant.
The results for sine, cosine and tangent are given below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-109.jpg?height=336&width=685&top_left_y=1265&top_left_x=947)

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\sin \left(180^{\circ}-\theta\right)=\sin \theta & \cos \left(180^{\circ}-\theta\right)=-\cos \theta & \tan \left(180^{\circ}-\theta\right)=-\tan \theta \\
\sin \left(180^{\circ}+\theta\right)=-\sin \theta & \cos \left(180^{\circ}+\theta\right)=-\cos \theta & \tan \left(180^{\circ}+\theta\right)=\tan \theta \\
\sin \left(360^{\circ}-\theta\right)=-\sin \theta & \cos \left(360^{\circ}-\theta\right)=\cos \theta & \tan \left(360^{\circ}-\theta\right)=-\tan \theta
\end{array}
$$

## Section 3.4 Sine Rule - Area of a triangle

In this section dealing with the sides and angles of any triangle, we will use the usual notation $A, B$ and $C$ to denote the angles and $a, b$ and $c$ to denote the sides opposite these angles.
In your study of trigonometry so far, you will have used the Theorem of Pythagoras to find sides and angles of a right-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-111.jpg?height=243&width=463&top_left_y=251&top_left_x=1169) angled triangle.
In order to deal with any triangle, we will establish the first of two very important relationships between the angles and sides of the triangle.
This rule is known as the sine rule.

## 1. The Sine Rule: $\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}$

## To prove the Sine rule $\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}$

## Mandatory Proof

Proof (i) Acute angled triangle
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-111.jpg?height=309&width=360&top_left_y=977&top_left_x=388)
i) $\frac{h}{b}=\sin A \quad \Rightarrow \quad h=b \sin A$
ii) $\frac{h}{a}=\sin B \quad \Rightarrow \quad h=a \sin B$
$\therefore a \sin B=b \sin A$
(ii) Obtuse angled triangle
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-111.jpg?height=305&width=501&top_left_y=974&top_left_x=1011)
i) $\frac{h}{b}=\sin A \quad \Rightarrow \quad h=b \sin A$
ii) $\frac{h}{a}=\sin \left(180^{\circ}-B\right) \Rightarrow h=a \sin \left(180^{\circ}-B\right)$

$$
\Rightarrow h=a \sin B
$$

$\therefore a \sin B=b \sin A$
(since $\left(180^{\circ}-B\right)$ is in the $2^{\text {nd }}$ quadrant with reference angle $B$ and sine is $(+)^{\text {ve }}$ in the $2^{\text {nd }}$ quadrant)

In both cases if we divide by $\sin A \sin B$ we get

$$
\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}
$$

Similarly it may be shown that $\frac{\boldsymbol{b}}{\boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }} \boldsymbol{B}}=\frac{\boldsymbol{c}}{\boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }} \boldsymbol{C}}$

$$
\therefore \frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}
$$

## Sine Rule $\quad \frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}$ or $\frac{\sin A}{a}=\frac{\sin B}{b}=\frac{\sin C}{c}$

Note: If we need to find an unknown angle using the sine rule, then $\frac{\sin A}{a}=\frac{\sin B}{b}$ is a more suitable form of the rule.

To use the sine rule to solve a triangle, we need to know one side and the angle opposite this side as well as one other angle or side.

## Example 1

In the triangle $\mathrm{ABC},|\mathrm{AB}|=8 \mathrm{~cm},|\angle \mathrm{BAC}|=30^{\circ}$ and $|\angle \mathrm{BCA}|=40^{\circ}$. Find $|\mathrm{BC}|$.

A sketch of the triangle is shown opposite.
Always draw a diagram of the triangle and add the information given.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-112.jpg?height=300&width=590&top_left_y=557&top_left_x=952)

From the triangle, $|\mathrm{AB}|=8, \mathrm{~A}=30^{\circ}$ and $\mathrm{C}=40^{\circ}$.

$$
\begin{array}{lr} 
& \frac{a}{\sin 30^{\circ}}=\frac{8}{\sin 40^{\circ}} \\
\Rightarrow & a \sin 40^{\circ}=8 \sin 30^{\circ} \\
\Rightarrow & a=\frac{8 \sin 30^{\circ}}{\sin 40^{\circ}} \\
\Rightarrow & a=6.22 \mathrm{~cm} \\
\Rightarrow & |\mathrm{BC}|=6.22 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{array}
$$

## Example 2

In the $\triangle \mathrm{ABC},|\mathrm{AB}|=3.8 \mathrm{~cm},|\mathrm{BC}|=5.2 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $|\angle \mathrm{BAC}|=35^{\circ}$. Find $|\angle \mathrm{ACB}|$.
In the triangle ABC
$\mathrm{A}=35^{\circ}, a=5.2 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $c=3.8 \mathrm{~cm}$

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl} 
& & \frac{\sin \mathrm{C}}{3.8} & =\frac{\sin 35^{\circ}}{5.2} \\
\Rightarrow & & \sin \mathrm{C} & =\frac{3.8 \sin 35^{\circ}}{5.2} \\
& & =0.4192 \\
\Rightarrow & & \mathrm{C} & =\sin ^{-1}(0.4192) \\
\Rightarrow & & \mathrm{C} & =24.8^{\circ} \\
\Rightarrow & & \angle \mathrm{ACB} & =24.8^{\circ}
\end{array}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-112.jpg?height=284&width=595&top_left_y=1560&top_left_x=961)

## Caution!

In a $\triangle \mathrm{ABC},|\mathrm{AC}|=4 \mathrm{~cm},|\mathrm{BC}|=6 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $|\angle \mathrm{ABC}|=30^{\circ}$.
If we construct this triangle with ruler and compass, we get the diagram shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-113.jpg?height=333&width=522&top_left_y=352&top_left_x=658)

There are two possible positions for vertex A , namely $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{A}_{2}$.
This situation arises when we are given two sides and a non-included angle.
When two possible triangles can be drawn, it is generally referred to as the ambiguous case.
In the triangle above, $\left|\angle \mathrm{BA}_{1} \mathrm{C}\right|=48.6^{\circ}$ and $\left|\angle \mathrm{BA}_{2} \mathrm{C}\right|=180^{\circ}-48.6^{\circ}$

$$
=131.4^{\circ}
$$

## Example 3

In a triangle $\mathrm{ABC},|\mathrm{AB}|=4 \mathrm{~cm},|\mathrm{AC}|=3 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $|\angle \mathrm{ABC}|=44^{\circ}$.
(i) Draw a sketch of the two possible triangles to satisfy this information.
(ii) Find the two possible values of $\angle \mathrm{ACB}$.
(i) The two possible triangles $\mathrm{ABC}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{ABC}_{2}$ are shown on the right.
(ii) $\frac{\sin \mathrm{C}}{4}=\frac{\sin 44^{\circ}}{3}$

$$
\begin{array}{lrl}
\Rightarrow & \sin \mathrm{C} & =\frac{4 \times \sin 44^{\circ}}{3}=0.9262 \\
\Rightarrow & \mathrm{C} & =\sin ^{-1}(0.9262) \\
\Rightarrow & \mathrm{C} & =67.9^{\circ} \text { or } 180^{\circ}-67.9^{\circ} \\
\Rightarrow & & \angle \mathrm{ACB} \\
= & 67.9^{\circ} \text { or } 112.1^{\circ}
\end{array}
$$

## 2. The area of a triangle

In the given triangle, $h$ is the perpendicular distance from A to $[\mathrm{BC}]$.
Area of $\triangle \mathrm{ABC}=\frac{1}{2}$ base $\times$ perpendicular height

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{2} a \times h \\
& =\frac{1}{2} a h
\end{aligned}
$$

But $\frac{h}{c}=\sin \mathrm{B} \quad \Rightarrow \quad h=c \sin \mathrm{~B}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-113.jpg?height=329&width=420&top_left_y=1849&top_left_x=1214)
$\Rightarrow \quad$ area of $\triangle \mathrm{ABC}=\frac{1}{2} a c \sin \mathrm{~B}$

By using different perpendicular heights, area of $\triangle \mathrm{ABC}=\frac{1}{2} a b \sin \mathrm{C} \quad$ or $\quad \frac{1}{2} a c \sin \mathrm{~B} \quad$ or $\quad \frac{1}{2} b c \sin \mathrm{~A}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Area of } \triangle \mathrm{ABC}= & \frac{1}{2} a b \sin \mathrm{C} \text { or } \frac{1}{2} a c \sin \mathrm{~B} \text { or } \frac{1}{2} b c \sin \mathrm{~A} \\
\text { In words, area }= & \text { half the product of any two sides multiplied } \\
& \text { by the sine of the angle between them. }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 4

If the area of the given triangle is $12 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, find the measure of the acute angle $A$, correct to the nearest degree.

Area of $\triangle=\frac{1}{2}(6)(7) \sin A$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{2}(6)(7) \sin A & =12 \\
\Rightarrow \quad \sin A & =\frac{12}{21}=0.5714 \\
\Rightarrow \quad A & =\sin ^{-1}(0.5714) \\
\Rightarrow \quad A & =34.8^{\circ}=35^{\circ}, \text { to the nearest degree }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 3.5 The Cosine rule

In the given triangle, we are given the lengths of the three sides but no angle. We cannot use the sine rule here to find the angle A .

Instead we use another rule for solving triangles.
It is called the cosine rule.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-117.jpg?height=253&width=439&top_left_y=557&top_left_x=1190)

The cosine rule states that for any triangle,

$$
a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b c \cos \mathrm{~A} .
$$

## The Cosine Rule: $\quad a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b c \cos \mathrm{~A}$

To prove the Cosine Rule $\boldsymbol{a}^{\mathbf{2}}=\boldsymbol{b}^{\mathbf{2}}+\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathbf{2}}-\mathbf{2} \boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{c} \cos \mathbf{A}$
Draw triangle with vertex $A$ at the origin, $B(c, 0)$ and point C making an obtuse angle with A .
Draw a circle of radius length $b$ with centre at A .
Since the coordinates of any point on a unit circle

## Mandatory Proof

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-117.jpg?height=211&width=354&top_left_y=1073&top_left_x=1242) can be written as ( $\cos \theta, \sin \theta$ ), the coordinates of C can now be written as $C(b \cos A, b \sin A)$. $|B C|=a$ and $|B C|$ is the distance from ( $c, 0$ ) to ( $b \cos A, b \sin A$ )

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow a^{2} & =(c-b \cos A)^{2}+(0-b \sin A)^{2} \\
\Rightarrow a^{2} & =c^{2}-2 b c \cos A+b^{2} \cos ^{2} A+b^{2} \sin ^{2} A \\
& =c^{2}-2 b c \cos A+b^{2}\left(\cos ^{2} A+\sin ^{2} A\right) \\
& =c^{2}-2 b c \cos A+b^{2} \quad\left(\cos ^{2} A+\sin ^{2} A=1\right) \\
\Rightarrow a^{2} & =b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b c \cos A
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-117.jpg?height=310&width=407&top_left_y=1316&top_left_x=1192)

Similarly it may be proved that
$b^{2}=a^{2}+c^{2}-2 a c \cos B$ and $c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2 a b \cos C$.

The cosine rule is generally used:
(i) to find the third side of a triangle when the other two sides and the included angle are given
(ii) to solve a triangle when the lengths of the three sides are given.

$$
a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b c \cos A
$$

or
$\cos A=\frac{b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}}{2 b c}$

$$
b^{2}=a^{2}+c^{2}-2 a c \cos B
$$

or

$$
\cos B=\frac{a^{2}+c^{2}-b^{2}}{2 a c}
$$

$$
c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2 a b \cos C
$$

or

$$
\cos C=\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}{2 a b}
$$

## Example 1

Find $|\mathrm{CB}|$.
Let $|\mathrm{CB}|=a$.
Using

$$
\begin{aligned}
a^{2} & =b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b c \cos \mathrm{~A} \\
a^{2} & =10^{2}+8^{2}-2(10)(8) \cos 50^{\circ} \\
& =100+64-160(0.6428) \\
a^{2} & =61.15 \\
a & =\sqrt{61.15}=7.8, \text { correct to one decimal place } \\
|\mathrm{CB}| & =7.8

$$

## Example 2

In the given triangle $\mathrm{PQR},|\mathrm{PR}|=7 \mathrm{~cm},|\mathrm{PQ}|=6.8 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $|\mathrm{RQ}|=9 \mathrm{~cm}$.
Find $|\angle \mathrm{RPQ}|$.
We require the angle P , so we start with $\cos \mathrm{P}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos \mathrm{P} & =\frac{q^{2}+r^{2}-p^{2}}{2 q r} \\
& =\frac{7^{2}+(6.8)^{2}-9^{2}}{2(7)(6.8)} \\
\Rightarrow \quad \cos \mathrm{P} & =0.1495 \\
\Rightarrow \quad \mathrm{P} & =\cos ^{-1}(0.1495) \\
\Rightarrow \quad|\angle \mathrm{RPQ}| & =81.4^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

If the wire makes an angle of $12^{\circ}$ with the hill, calculate the
(i) height of the pole $h$, correct to 2 decimal places
(ii) the length of the wire AB

Draw horizontal lines through B and A .

$$
\begin{gathered}
\angle C B D=8^{\circ} \\
\therefore \angle A B D=20^{\circ}

$$

$\therefore \angle E A B=20^{\circ} \quad \ldots$ (alternate angles)
$\therefore \angle B A C=70^{\circ}$
Also $\angle A C B=98^{\circ} \quad \ldots\left(180^{\circ}-12^{\circ}-70^{\circ}\right)$
(i) $\frac{h}{\sin 12}=\frac{20}{\sin 70} \Rightarrow h=\frac{20 \times \sin 12}{\sin 70}=4.43 \mathrm{~m}$
(ii) $|A B|^{2}=20^{2}+4.43^{2}-2 \times 20 \times 4.43 \times \cos (98)=444.286$
$\therefore|A B|=21.07 \mathrm{~m}$

## Section 3.6 Problems in three dimensions

In this section you will deal with trigonometric problems in three dimensions.
One of the first things you are required to do is to identify which angles or which lengths you need to calculate. For this reason it is of the utmost importance that you sketch good diagrams.

Most problems in three dimensions consist of a series of connected triangles. It is important to identify right-angled triangles in particular. If we require an angle or length in a particular triangle, it simplifies the work if the triangle is drawn separately. From this point on you can work from a two-dimensional figure, just as you have been doing so far in this chapter.

In this cube there are many connected right-angled triangles.

The triangle HED can be used to find the length of the side [HD].

The side [HD] can be used in the triangle AHD to find $|\mathrm{AD}|$ and $|\angle \mathrm{ADH}|$.

## Example 1

(i) Redraw $\triangle \mathrm{HED}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
|\mathrm{HD}|^{2} & =5^{2}+5^{2} \\
& =50 \\
\Rightarrow \quad|\mathrm{HD}| & =\sqrt{50}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) Redraw $\triangle \mathrm{AHD}$

$$
\tan \theta=\frac{5}{\sqrt{50}}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \quad \theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{5}{\sqrt{50}}\right)
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \quad \theta=35.26^{\circ}
$$

## Example 2

(i) Calculate the length of the edge [AV].
(ii) Hence calculate, correct to the nearest whole number, the total area of the four triangular faces.
(i) Using the base ABCD :

$$
\begin{aligned}
|\mathrm{AC}|^{2} & =4^{2}+4^{2} \\
|\mathrm{AC}|^{2} & =32 \\
\Rightarrow|\mathrm{AC}| & =\sqrt{32} \\
|\mathrm{AO}| & =\frac{1}{2}|\mathrm{AC}|=\frac{\sqrt{32}}{2} \mathrm{~m}

$$

(ii) Area of face AVD:

$$
\begin{aligned}
h^{2}+2^{2} & =(\sqrt{17})^{2} \\
h^{2}+4 & =17 \\
h^{2} & =13 \quad \Rightarrow \quad h=\sqrt{13} \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Area of $\triangle \mathrm{AVD}=\frac{1}{2}(4 \mathrm{~cm})(\sqrt{13})$

$$
=2 \sqrt{13} \mathrm{~m}^{2}
$$

Area of 4 faces $=4(2 \sqrt{13}) \mathrm{m}^{2}$

$$
=28.84 \mathrm{~m}^{2}
$$

$=29 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, correct to the nearest whole number.

$$
\begin{aligned}
|\mathrm{AV}|^{2} & =3^{2}+\left(\frac{\sqrt{32}}{2}\right)^{2} \\
& =9+\frac{32}{4} \\
& =17 \\
\Rightarrow \quad|\mathrm{AV}| & =\sqrt{17} \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Give your answer correct to the nearest metre.
(i) Using $\triangle \mathrm{ADC}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& & \frac{100}{|\mathrm{CA}|} & =\tan 20^{\circ} \\
\Rightarrow & & |\mathrm{CA}| \tan 20^{\circ} & =100 \\
\Rightarrow & & |\mathrm{CA}| & =\frac{100}{\tan 20^{\circ}}=\frac{100}{0.364} \\
\Rightarrow & & |\mathrm{CA}| & =274.7 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) Using $\triangle \mathrm{BCD}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{100}{|\mathrm{CB}|}=\tan 15^{\circ} \\

(iii) Using $\triangle \mathrm{ACB}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& |\mathrm{AB}|^{2}=(373.2)^{2}+(274.7)^{2} \\
& \quad \quad-2(373.2)(274.7) \cos 60^{\circ} \\

## Section 3.7 Graphs of trigonometric functions

## Graph of $y=\sin x$

Consider a point A on a unit circle.
The $y$-coordinate of this point is the length of the opposite side of a right-angled triangle.

The sine ratio (at this point) is
$\sin x=\frac{\text { Opposite }}{\text { Hypotenuse }}=\frac{\text { Opposite }}{1}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-128.jpg?height=432&width=640&top_left_y=1835&top_left_x=991)

As the point moves around the circle, the angle increases from 0 to $2 \pi$ radians $\left(0^{\circ}\right.$ to $\left.360^{\circ}\right)$.
At the same time the $y$-coordinate of A changes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 to 0 .
By measuring the length of the opposite $(y)$ and the angle $(x)$ contained, a set of ordered pairs ( $x, y$ ) is created. When plotted these points all lie on a smooth curve, $y=\sin x$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-129.jpg?height=284&width=1420&top_left_y=424&top_left_x=209)

It is also clear that the point can continue to rotate making larger angles but the $y$-value continues to repeat within a range of values $[-1,1]$.

This function, $y=\sin x$, is therefore said to be periodic.
The shortest measurement along the $x$-axis after which it repeats is the period of the function.
The period of $y=\sin x$ is $360^{\circ}$ or $2 \pi$ radians.
The period of a function, $f$, is a positive number $\boldsymbol{a}$ such that $f(x+a)=f(x)$.
The period of $\sin (x)$ is $2 \pi$ as $\sin (x+2 \pi)=\sin (x)$.

## Graph of $\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{\operatorname { c o s }} \boldsymbol{x}$

The cosine function, $\cos x=\frac{\text { Adjacent }}{\text { Hypotenuse }}=\frac{\text { Adjacent }}{1}$, is also a periodic function.

When the angle $x=0^{\circ}$, the Adjacent side $=1$
As $x$ increases to $90^{\circ}$, the Adjacent side decreases to 0 .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-129.jpg?height=428&width=496&top_left_y=1309&top_left_x=1133)

As $x$ increases further (past $90^{\circ}$ ), the adjacent side becomes negative and decreases in value to -1 .

The cosine graph repeats after $2 \pi$.

The period of $\cos x$ is $2 \pi$ radians and its range is $[-1,1]$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-129.jpg?height=369&width=899&top_left_y=1756&top_left_x=729)

## Graph of $\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{\operatorname { t a n }} \boldsymbol{x}$

Since $\tan x=\frac{\text { opposite }}{\text { adjacent }}$, at $x=0$, the opposite is zero
$\therefore \tan 0=0$.
As the angle $x$ increases the opposite side increases as the adjacent decreases.
At $x=\frac{\pi}{4}$, the opposite and adjacent sides have the same length $\therefore \tan \frac{\pi}{4}=1$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-130.jpg?height=489&width=802&top_left_y=161&top_left_x=825)

However as $x$ approaches $90^{\circ}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right.$ radians $)$, the opposite approaches 1 while the adjacent approaches zero and so $\tan \frac{\pi}{2}=\frac{\text { opposite }}{\text { adjacent }}$, is undefined.
We cannot get a value for $\tan x$ when $x= \pm 90^{\circ}, \pm 270^{\circ}, \ldots$
Note: $\tan \left(89^{\circ}\right) \approx \frac{1}{0.02} \approx 57.3$ (try to imagine the position of the point $\left(89^{\circ}, 57.3\right)$ on the $y=\tan x$ graph above)

The curve gets closer and closer to the $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$ line but never touches it.
The lines $x=\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3 \pi}{2}, \frac{5 \pi}{2} \ldots$ and $x=\frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{-3 \pi}{2}, \frac{-5 \pi}{2} \ldots$ are asymptotes to the curve.
As can be seen from the graph, $\tan x$ has a period of $\pi$ radians $\left(180^{\circ}\right)$.
Its range is R , the set of real numbers.

| Function | Domain | Range | Period |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $y=\sin x$ | $\mathbb{R}$ | $[-1,1]$ | $360^{\circ}(2 \pi$ radians $)$ |
| $y=\cos x$ | $\mathbb{R}$ | $[-1,1]$ | $360^{\circ}(2 \pi$ radians $)$ |
| $y=\tan x$ | $\mathbb{R} \backslash\left\{ \pm 90^{\circ}, \pm 270^{\circ}, \ldots\right\}$ | $\mathbb{R}$ | $180^{\circ}(\pi$ radians $)$ |

## Example 1

Draw a graph of $y=\cos x$ in the domain $-360^{\circ} \leqslant x \leqslant 360^{\circ}$. Show on the graph that there are four angles in this domain that satisfy the equation $\cos x=\frac{1}{2}$. A sketch of the graph is shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-130.jpg?height=411&width=753&top_left_y=1603&top_left_x=816)

The line $y=\frac{1}{2}$ (i.e. $\cos x=\frac{1}{2}$ ) intersects the graph at four points.
The points where the vertical lines from these intersections meet the $x$-axis give the values of the four angles.

## Exercise 3.7

## Section 3.8 Related trigonometric graphs

The main features of trigonometric graphs are:
(a) Range: the interval on the $y$-axis from the lowest to the highest value.
(b) Midline: a horizontal line which lies halfway between the highest and lowest points.
(c) Amplitude: the distance between the midline and the maximum or minimum values of the graph.
(d) Period: the shortest distance along the $x$-axis after which the graph repeats itself.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-132.jpg?height=565&width=588&top_left_y=1455&top_left_x=1040)

## 1. Changes to the amplitude, $y=b \sin x$

For $y=2 \sin x$ every value of $\sin x$ is multiplied by 2 , the graph stretches in the $y$ direction by a factor of 2 . The amplitude is now 2.

The amplitude of $y=b \sin x$ is $|\boldsymbol{b}|$.
The period does not change, however, the range changes from $[-1,1]$ to $[-2,2]$.

The range of $y=\sin x$ is $[-1,1]$
The range of $y=b \sin x$ is $[-|b|,|b|]$
Similarly $y=b \cos x$ has an amplitude of $|b|$ and a range
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-133.jpg?height=576&width=437&top_left_y=172&top_left_x=1191) of $[-|b|,|b|]$

If $b=-1$ then the graphs, $y=-\sin x$ and $y=-\cos x$ are reflections in the $x$-axis of $y=\sin x$ and $y=\cos x$ repectively.
(Note; the amplitude remains $|-1|=1$ )
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-133.jpg?height=546&width=544&top_left_y=972&top_left_x=256)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-133.jpg?height=546&width=545&top_left_y=972&top_left_x=859)
2. Changes to the period $y=\sin (c x)$

| $\boldsymbol{x}$ | $0^{\circ}$ | $45^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ | $135^{\circ}$ | $180^{\circ}$ | $225^{\circ}$ | $270^{\circ}$ | $315^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\boldsymbol{2} \boldsymbol{x}$ | $0^{\circ}$ | $90^{\circ}$ | $180^{\circ}$ | $270^{\circ}$ | $360^{\circ}$ | $450^{\circ}$ | $540^{\circ}$ | $630^{\circ}$ | $720^{\circ}$ |
| $\boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }} \mathbf{2} \boldsymbol{x}$ | 0 | 1 | 0 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | -1 | 0 |

The graph of $y=\sin 2 x$ has the same overall shape as $y=\sin x$ but the period has decreased to $180^{\circ}$ ( $\pi$ radians).
In other words two sine curves fit into the domain $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$.
$\therefore$ for $\sin 2 x$, the period is $\frac{360^{\circ}}{2}=180^{\circ}$
In general for $y=\sin n x, \boldsymbol{n}$ sine waves fit into the domain $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-133.jpg?height=367&width=546&top_left_y=1825&top_left_x=1085)
$\therefore y=\sin n x$ has a period of $\frac{360^{\circ}}{n}=\frac{2 \pi}{n}$.

$$
\text { e.g., } \begin{aligned}
y & =\sin 3 x \text { has a period of } \frac{2 \pi}{3} \\
y & =\sin \frac{x}{4} \text { has a period of } \frac{2 \pi}{\frac{1}{4}}=8 \pi
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly $y=\cos n x$ has a period of $\frac{2 \pi}{n}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-134.jpg?height=296&width=1291&top_left_y=399&top_left_x=222)
3. Graphs of the form, $y=a+b \sin (c x)$ and $y=a+b \cos (c x)$

The graph of $y=1+\cos x$ is obtained from the graph of $y=\cos x$ by a translation of 1 unit in the positive direction of the $y$-axis.

Adding 1 unit to $y=\cos x$ does not change the period or the amplitude of the function.

Adding 1 unit does change the maximum and minimum values of the function and so changes the range.

It therefore changes the mid-line as well.
The mid-line of $y=1+\cos x$ is $y=1$
The range of $y=\cos x$ is $[-1,1]$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-134.jpg?height=597&width=599&top_left_y=805&top_left_x=1030)

The range of $y=1+\cos x$ is $[0,2]$
The range of $y=-1+\cos x$ is $[-2,0]$

In general for graphs of the form, $y=a+b \sin (c x)$ and $y=a+b \cos (c x)$
(i) $y=a$ is the the mid-line
(ii) the amplitude is $|b|$
(iii) $y=a+|b|$ is the maximum value of the curve $y=a-|b|$ is the minimum value of the curve
(iv) The range is $[a-|b|, a+|b|]$
(v) The period is $\left(\frac{2 \pi}{c}\right)$ radians or $\left(\frac{360^{\circ}}{c}\right)$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-134.jpg?height=494&width=564&top_left_y=1592&top_left_x=1029)

(iii) the $x$-distance between the max and min points $=\left(\frac{\text { period }}{2}\right)=2.4-(-2.4)=4.8$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \text { period }=4.8 \times 2 & =9.6=\frac{360^{\circ}}{c} \\

(ii) The period of $y=3+4 \sin (2 t)$ is $\frac{2 \pi}{2}=\pi$ seconds

## Section 3.9 General solutions of trigonometric equations

In Section 3.3 we solved equations such as $\sin x=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ for angles in the range $0 \leqslant x \leqslant 360^{\circ}$ (or $0 \leqslant x \leqslant 2 \pi$ ).
This generally gave us two values for the angle $x$.
Consider again the equation $\cos \theta=\frac{1}{2}$.
A calculator in degree mode gives an answer of $60^{\circ}$.
But recall that this is only the principal value.
Check that $\theta=300^{\circ}$ and $\theta=420^{\circ}$ also work.
The equation $\cos \theta=\frac{1}{2}$ has no restriction on the set of values of $\theta$ that are solutions.

The graph below shows the function $y=\cos \theta$ and the function $y=\frac{1}{2}$.
The graph shows that there is an infinite number of solutions to the equation $\cos \theta=\frac{1}{2}$ as the graph of $y=\cos \theta$ repeats itself indefinitely.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-140.jpg?height=324&width=1119&top_left_y=324&top_left_x=360)

In the range $0^{\circ} \leqslant \theta \leqslant 360^{\circ}$, there are two values of $\theta$ for which $\cos \theta=\frac{1}{2}$.
These value are $60^{\circ}$ and $300^{\circ}$.
Notice that the value $\theta=420^{\circ}$ is $60^{\circ}+360^{\circ}$ and $\theta=660^{\circ}$ is $300^{\circ}+360^{\circ}$.
Thus further solutions of the equation are found by repeatedly adding $360^{\circ}$ to the angles $60^{\circ}$ and $300^{\circ}$.

So the solutions to the equation $\cos \theta=\frac{1}{2}$ are

$$
\theta=60^{\circ}+n 360^{\circ} \text { or } \theta=300^{\circ}+n 360^{\circ}, \text { where } n \text { is an integer. }
$$

This is called the general solution of the equation.
We can find the general solution of any trigonometric equation in the form $\sin \theta=k$ or $\cos \theta=k$ in the same way.
This method is given below.

Remember
To find the general solution of $\sin x=k$ or $\cos x=k$, you find the two solutions in the interval $0^{\circ} \leqslant \theta \leqslant 360^{\circ}$ and then add $n 360^{\circ}$ to each of the solutions.

## Example 1

Find the general solution of the equation $\cos \theta=-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \theta$ in radians.
$\cos \theta=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta=\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)=\frac{\pi}{6}\left(30^{\circ}\right) \ldots$ the reference angle cosine is negative in the 2 nd and 3rd quadrants.
$\cos \theta=-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \Rightarrow \theta=\frac{\pi}{6}$ in the 2nd and 3rd

$$
\Rightarrow \quad \theta=\frac{5 \pi}{6} \quad \text { or } \quad \frac{7 \pi}{6}
$$

The general solution is $2 n \pi+\frac{5 \pi}{6}$ or $2 n \pi+\frac{7 \pi}{6}, n \in Z$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-140.jpg?height=515&width=517&top_left_y=1699&top_left_x=1043)

## Example 2

Solve the equation $\sin 3 \theta=\frac{1}{2}$, for $\theta \in \mathbf{R}, \theta$ in radians.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin 3 \theta=\frac{1}{2} & \Rightarrow 3 \theta=\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{\pi}{6} \\
& \Rightarrow 3 \theta=\frac{\pi}{6} \text { or } \frac{5 \pi}{6} \ldots \text { sine is positive in the } 1 \text { st and } 2 \text { nd quadrants }
\end{aligned}
$$

All the solutions for $3 \theta$ (i.e. the general solution) are

The full general solution should be found for $3 \theta$ before dividing by 3 to find the general values for $\theta$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
3 \theta & =2 n \pi+\frac{\pi}{6} \quad \text { or } \quad 2 n \pi+\frac{5 \pi}{6} \\
\Rightarrow \quad \theta & =\frac{2 n \pi}{3}+\frac{\pi}{18} \quad \text { or } \quad \frac{2 n \pi}{3}+\frac{5 \pi}{18}, n \in Z
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: The following example illustrates how we use the general solution of an equation to find all the solutions in a given interval.

## Example 3

Find all the solutions for $\cos 2 \theta=-\frac{1}{2}$ for $0^{\circ} \leqslant \theta \leqslant 360^{\circ}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos 2 \theta=-\frac{1}{2} & \Rightarrow 2 \theta=\cos ^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \\
& \Rightarrow 2 \theta=60^{\circ} \ldots \text { the reference angle }
\end{aligned}
$$

cosine is negative in the 2 nd and 3rd quadrants.

$$
\Rightarrow 2 \theta=120^{\circ} \text { or } 240^{\circ}
$$

To find all the solutions we add $n\left(360^{\circ}\right)$ to each angle.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad 2 \theta=120^{\circ}+n\left(360^{\circ}\right) \text { or } 2 \theta=240^{\circ}+n\left(360^{\circ}\right) \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \theta=60^{\circ}+n\left(180^{\circ}\right) \text { or } \theta=120^{\circ}+n\left(180^{\circ}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-141.jpg?height=315&width=312&top_left_y=1290&top_left_x=1228)

To find the values of $\theta$ in the range $0^{\circ} \leqslant \theta \leqslant 360^{\circ}$, we let $n=0,1,2,3, \ldots$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& n=0 \Rightarrow \theta=60^{\circ} \text { or } 120^{\circ} \\
& n=1 \Rightarrow \theta=240^{\circ} \text { or } 300^{\circ} \\
& n=2 \Rightarrow \theta=420^{\circ} \text { or } 480^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $420^{\circ}$ and $480^{\circ}$ are outside the range $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$, we disregard these values.
Thus the values of $\theta$ are $60^{\circ}, 120^{\circ}, 240^{\circ}, 300^{\circ}$.

## Section 4.1 Revision of formulae

In this section we will deal with some coordinate geometry formulae that you will have met in the course of your work for the Junior Certificate. The main formulae dealing with coordinates are given below:

1. Distance between two points

The distance between $\mathrm{A}\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\mathrm{B}\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ is $|\mathrm{AB}|=\sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-150.jpg?height=364&width=628&top_left_y=1027&top_left_x=1006)
2. The midpoint of a line segment

The midpoint M of the line segment joining $\mathrm{A}\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\mathrm{B}\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ is

$$
\left(\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}, \quad \frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}\right)
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-150.jpg?height=343&width=527&top_left_y=1427&top_left_x=1024)

## 3. The slope of a line

In the diagram on the right, the slope, $m$, of AB is found by getting the value of

$$
\frac{\text { vertical change }}{\text { horizontal change }}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}
$$

The slope, $m$, of the line passing through ( $x_{1}, y_{1}$ ) and ( $x_{2}, y_{2}$ ) is

$$
m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-150.jpg?height=371&width=625&top_left_y=1880&top_left_x=1003)

## 4. Positive and negative slopes

As we go from left to right, the slope is positive if the line is rising and the slope is negative if the line is falling.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-151.jpg?height=324&width=559&top_left_y=324&top_left_x=640)

The slope of a horizontal line is zero.

## 5. Parallel lines

The lines $a$ and $b$ in the given diagram both have the slope $\frac{3}{2}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-151.jpg?height=555&width=605&top_left_y=882&top_left_x=617)

These lines are parallel.

## 6. Perpendicular lines

The given lines $a$ and $b$ are perpendicular.
The slope of $a$ is $\frac{3}{2}$.
The slope of $b=-\frac{2}{3}$.
Notice that one slope is the reciprocal of the other with the sign changed.

Notice also that the product of the two slopes is -1 , i.e.,

$$
-\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{2}=-1
$$

If two lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1 , i.e.,

$$
m_{1} \times m_{2}=-1
$$

Parallel lines have equal slopes.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-151.jpg?height=552&width=505&top_left_y=1624&top_left_x=1124)

## Example 1

$\mathrm{A}(3,1), \mathrm{B}(2,-3)$ and $\mathrm{C}(-1, k)$ are three points in the plane.
If $\mathrm{AB} \perp \mathrm{AC}$, find the value of $k$.
$\mathrm{A}(3,1)$ and $\mathrm{B}(2,-3)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{A}(3,1) \text { and } \mathrm{C}(-1, k) \\
& \text { Slope of } \mathrm{AC}=\frac{k-1}{-1-3} \\
&=\frac{k-1}{-4}
\end{aligned}
$$

If $\mathrm{AB} \perp \mathrm{AC}$, then the product of the slopes equals -1 .

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad 4 \times \frac{k-1}{-4}=-1 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \frac{4(k-1)}{-4}=-1 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \frac{4(k-1)}{4}=1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k-1=1 \\
& \quad \Rightarrow \quad k=2
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Slope of } \mathrm{AB} & =\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} \\
& =\frac{-3-1}{2-3} \\
& =\frac{-4}{-1}=4
\end{aligned}
$$

lopes equals -1

$$
\text { Area }=\frac{1}{2}\left|x_{1} y_{2}-x_{2} y_{1}\right|
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-154.jpg?height=324&width=456&top_left_y=253&top_left_x=918)

## Example 1

Find the area of the triangle with vertices $(0,0),(-2,1)$ and $(3,4)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Area } & =\frac{1}{2}\left|x_{1} y_{2}-x_{2} y_{1}\right| \\
& =\frac{1}{2}|(-2)(4)-(3)(1)| \\
& =\frac{1}{2}|-8-3| \\

\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right) & \left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right) \\
\downarrow & \downarrow \\
(-2,1) & (3,4)

## Section 4.3 The equation of a line

The equation of a line is generally given in the form $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{y}+\boldsymbol{c}=\mathbf{0}$, e.g., $2 x+3 y-12=0$.
This may be described as the general form of the equation of a line.
To find the equation of a line, we generally need to know
(i) a point on the line
(ii) the slope of the line.

If $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope, we then use $\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{y}_{1}=\boldsymbol{m}\left(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_{1}\right)$ to find the equation of the line.

## The equation $\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{m} \boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{c}$

If the equation of a line is in the form

$$
y=m x+c, \text { then }
$$

(i) the slope is $m$
(ii) the line intersects the $y$-axis at $(0, c)$.
$c$ is the value of $y$ at the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis and is called the $y$ intercept.

The equation of a line with slope $m$ and containing the point ( $x_{1}, y_{1}$ ) is

$$
y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right)
$$

The equation $\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{m} \boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{c}$ is generally referred to as the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line.

If the equation of a line is in the form $2 x+3 y-7=0$, we express it in the form $y=m x+c$. The slope is $m$.

For example, if $\quad 3 x-4 y+3=0$, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
-4 y & =-3 x-3 \\
\Rightarrow \quad 4 y & =3 x+3 \Rightarrow y=\frac{3}{4} x+\frac{3}{4} \Rightarrow m=\frac{3}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: The slope of a line is defined as the tangent of the angle which the line makes with the positive direction of the $x$-axis.

1. If the angle is less than $90^{\circ}$, the slope is positive.
2. If the angle is between $90^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$, the slope is negative.
3. $\tan 45^{\circ}=1 ; \tan 135^{\circ}=-1$

## Example 1

Find the equation of the line through the point $(-2,3)$ which is perpendicular to the line $2 x-y+5=0$.

To find the slope of $2 x-y+5=0$, we express it in the form $y=m x+c$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 x-y+5=0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad & -y=-2 x-5 \\
\Rightarrow \quad & y=2 x+5 \ldots \quad \text { multiply each term by }-1 \\
\Rightarrow \quad & \text { the slope is } 2 .
\end{aligned}
$$

The slope of the line perpendicular to this line is $-\frac{1}{2}$.
Equation of line through $(-2,3)$ with slope $-\frac{1}{2}$ is:

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
y-y_{1} & =m\left(x-x_{1}\right) & \left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right) & =(-2,3) \\
y-3 & =-\frac{1}{2}(x+2) & m & =-\frac{1}{2} \\
y-3 & =\frac{-x}{2}-1 & \\
\Rightarrow & 2 y-6 & =-x-2 \ldots & \text { multiply each term by } 2 \\
\Rightarrow & x+2 y & -4=0 \text { is the required equation. }
\end{array}
$$

## More difficult problems

To find the equation of a line (or lines) we generally require two pieces of information.
From the information given it may not be possible to find a point on the line and the slope of the line immediately. When dealing with more difficult problems, the following approaches should prove useful.

1. The equation of any line through the point $(3,4)$, for example, is $y-4=m(x-3)$, i.e. $m x-y-3 m+4=0$.

A second condition should enable us to find the value or values of $m$.
2. The equation of any line parallel to $\mathbf{2} \boldsymbol{x}-\mathbf{3} \boldsymbol{y}+8=0$ is $\mathbf{2} \boldsymbol{x}-\mathbf{3} \boldsymbol{y}+\boldsymbol{c}=0$.

The equation of any line perpendicular to $2 x-3 y+8=0$ is $3 x+2 y+k=0$.
The equation of any line parallel to $a x+b y+c=0$ is $a x+b y+k=0$.
The equation of any line perpendicular to $a x+b y+c=0$ is $b x-a y+k=0$.

## To find where a line intersects the axes

To find the point of intersection of a line and
(i) the $x$-axis, let $y=0$ and find the $x$-value
(ii) the $y$-axis, let $x=0$ and find the $y$-value.

## Example 2

Find the value of $k$ if the lines $2 x+k y+5=0$ and $(k+6) x+2 y-9=0$ are perpendicular to each other.
$2 x+k y+5=0 \Rightarrow$ the slope $m_{1}=\frac{-2}{k}$
$(k+6) x+2 y-9=0 \Rightarrow$ the slope $m_{2}=\frac{-(k+6)}{2}$
Since the lines are perpendicular, $m_{1} \times m_{2}=-1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow & & \frac{-(k+6)}{2}\left(\frac{-2}{k}\right) & =-1 \\
\Rightarrow & & \frac{2(k+6)}{2 k} & =-1 \\
\Rightarrow & & k+6 & =-k \\
\Rightarrow & & 2 k & =-6 \\
\Rightarrow & & k & =-3
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

Find the equations of the line $l$ through the point $(4,2)$ so that the area of the triangle formed by $l$ and the positive $x$ and $y$-axes is 25 square units.

Equation of any line through $(4,2)$ is

$$
y-2=m(x-4)
$$

i.e. $m x-y+2-4 m=0$
$l$ intersects the $x$-axis at $y=0$
$y=0 \Rightarrow x=\frac{4 m-2}{m}$
$x=0 \Rightarrow y=2-4 m$
Area of shaded $\triangle=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{4 m-2}{m}\right)(2-4 m)$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-158.jpg?height=461&width=527&top_left_y=1377&top_left_x=1024)

Area $=25 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{4 m-2}{m}\right)(2-4 m)=25$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow(4 m-2)(2-4 m) \quad=50 m \\
& \Rightarrow 8 m-16 m^{2}-4+8 m=50 m \\
& \Rightarrow 16 m^{2}+34 m+4 \quad=0 \\
& \Rightarrow(16 m+2)(m+2) \quad=0 \\
& \Rightarrow m=-\frac{1}{8} \text { or } m \quad=-2
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore$ the equations of the line $l$ are
(i) $y-2=-\frac{1}{8}(x-4) \quad$ or
(ii) $\begin{array}{ll} & y-2=-2(x-4) \\ & \Rightarrow y-2=-2 x+8 \\ & \Rightarrow 2 x+y-10=0\end{array}$
$\therefore$ the two equations are $x+8 y-20=0$ and $2 x+y-10=0$

Note: To verify that a point is on a given line, we substitute the coordinates of $x$ and $y$ into the equation of the line. If the coordinates satisfy the equation, then the point is on the line.

For example, the point $(-3,2) \in 2 x-4 y+14=0$, because

$$
\begin{aligned}
2(-3)-4(2)+14 & =-6-8+14 \\
& =0
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 4.5 Concurrencies of a triangle

The line which joins a vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side is called a median.

In the given triangle [AM] is the median.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-162.jpg?height=301&width=536&top_left_y=1844&top_left_x=1095)

## 1. The Centroid

The given diagram shows the three medians $[\mathrm{AE}],[\mathrm{BF}]$ and $[\mathrm{CD}]$ intersecting at the point G .
G is called the centroid of the triangle.
The medians of a triangle divide each other in the ratio $2: 1$.

In the given triangle,
$|\mathrm{AG}|:|\mathrm{GE}|=2: 1 ; \quad|\mathrm{BG}|:|\mathrm{GF}|=2: 1$ and
$|\mathrm{CG}|:|\mathrm{GD}|=2: 1$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-163.jpg?height=394&width=555&top_left_y=232&top_left_x=1080)

If $\mathrm{A}\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right), \mathrm{B}\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ and $\mathrm{C}\left(x_{3}, y_{3}\right)$ are the coordinates of the vertices of a triangle, then the coordinates of the centroid, G , are

$$
\mathrm{G}=\left(\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}}{3}, \frac{y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}}{3}\right)
$$

## 2. The circumcentre

The circumcentre of a triangle is the point of intersection of the mediators (the perpendicular bisectors of the sides) of a triangle.
The line segment from a vertex of a triangle to the circumcentre is the radius of the circumcircle.
This is shown here as $r$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-163.jpg?height=461&width=461&top_left_y=1000&top_left_x=1170)

## 3. The orthocentre

The orthocentre of a triangle is the point of intersection of the perpendiculars from the vertices to the opposite sides.
In the given triangle, H is the orthocentre.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-163.jpg?height=333&width=546&top_left_y=1550&top_left_x=1085)

## Example 1

The vertices of a triangle are $\mathrm{A}(-4,3), \mathrm{B}(0,-5)$ and $\mathrm{C}(3,4)$. Find the coordinates of
(i) the centroid
(ii) the orthocentre of the triangle.
(i) Centroid $=\left(\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}}{3}, \frac{y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}}{3}\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\left(\frac{-4+3+0}{3}, \frac{3+4+(-5)}{3}\right) \\
& =\left(-\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) The orthocentre is the point of intersection of the perpendiculars from the vertices to the opposite sides, as shown.
(Two perpendiculars are sufficient.)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-164.jpg?height=574&width=567&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=1032)

$$
\text { Slope of } \mathrm{BC}=\frac{4+5}{3-0}=\frac{9}{3}=3
$$

$\Rightarrow$ slope of $\mathrm{AE}=-\frac{1}{3}$
Equation of AE: $y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right) \quad\left(x, y_{1}\right)=(-4,3)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
y-3 & =-\frac{1}{3}(x+4) \\
\Rightarrow \quad 3 y-9 & =-x-4 \\
\Rightarrow \quad x+3 y-5 & =0 \ldots 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Slope of AC: $\frac{4-3}{3+4}=\frac{1}{7}$
$\Rightarrow \quad$ slope of $\mathrm{BD}=-7$
Equation of $\mathrm{BD}: \quad y+5=-7(x-0) \quad \mathrm{B}=(0,-5)$

$$
\Rightarrow 7 x+y+5=0 \ldots \text { (2) }
$$

Solving equations (1) and (2): $x+3 y=5 \ldots$ (1)

$$
\begin{equation*}
7 x+y=-5 . \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

(1) $\quad x+3 y=5$
(2) $\times 3: \quad 21 x+3 y=-15$
$\therefore$ the coordinates of the orthocentre are $(-1,2)$

## Exercise 4.5

(i) $(2,-3),(4,0)$ and $(-3,9)$
(ii) $(1,3),(6,2)$ and $(5,-2)$.

6. Show that the circumcentre of the triangle with vertices $(-2,2),(-4,-2)$ and $(5,-5)$ is $(1,-2)$.
7. $\mathrm{A}(4,6), \mathrm{B}(-2,7)$ and $\mathrm{C}(k,-4)$ are the vertices of a triangle.

If the coordinates of the centroid of the triangle are $(-1,3)$, find the value of $k$.

## Section 4.6 Perpendicular distance from a point to a line

The perpendicular distance, $d$, from the point $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ to the line $a x+b y+c=0$ is given by the formula

$$
d=\frac{\left|a x_{1}+b y_{1}+c\right|}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-165.jpg?height=312&width=395&top_left_y=792&top_left_x=1066)

## Example 1

(i) Find the perpendicular distance from the point $(1,-4)$ to the line $3 x-y-2=0$.
(ii) Find the distance between the parallel lines $3 x-4 y+12=0$ and $3 x-4 y-1=0$.
(i) Perpendicular distance $=\frac{\left|a x_{1}+b y_{1}+c\right|}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}} \ldots\left\{\begin{array}{c}a x+b y+c=3 x-y-2 \\ \left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)=(1,-4)\end{array}\right\}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{|3(1)+(-1)(-4)+(-2)|}{\sqrt{3^{2}+1^{2}}} \\
& =\frac{5}{\sqrt{10}}=\frac{5 \sqrt{10}}{10}=\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) To find the distance between two parallel lines, we find a point on one of the lines and then find the distance from that point to the other line.
A point on the line $3 x-4 y+12=0$ is $(0,3)$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-165.jpg?height=184&width=386&top_left_y=1747&top_left_x=1158)

Perpendicular distance from $(0,3)$ to $3 x-4 y-1=0$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
d=\frac{|3(0)+(-4)(3)-1|}{\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}} & =\frac{|-12-1|}{\sqrt{25}} \\
& =\frac{|-13|}{5}=\frac{13}{5}=2 \frac{3}{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Points in relation to a given line

The sign of the expression inside the modulus signs can be very useful when we are investigating whether points are on the same side or opposite sides of a given line.

1. Perpendiculars to a line from points on the same side of the line have the same sign.
2. Perpendiculars from points on opposite sides of a line have different signs.

## Example 2

Investigate whether the points $(5,-2)$ and $(3,-3)$ lie on the same side of the line $5 x-4 y-30=0$.

The perpendicular distance from $(5,-2)$ to the line $5 x-4 y-30=0$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Distance } & =\frac{a x_{1}+b y_{1}+c}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}} \\
& =\frac{5(5)+(-4)(-2)-30}{\sqrt{5^{2}+4^{2}}} \\
& =\frac{25+8-30}{\sqrt{41}}=\frac{3}{\sqrt{41}} \ldots \text { positive }
\end{aligned}
$$

Here we do not use the modulus bars || as we require a positive or negative answer.

The perpendicular distance from $(3,-3)$ to the line $5 x-4 y-30=0$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Distance } & =\frac{5(3)+(-4)(-3)-30}{\sqrt{5^{2}+4^{2}}} \\
& =\frac{15+12-30}{\sqrt{41}}=\frac{-3}{\sqrt{41}} \ldots \text { negative }
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the perpendicular distances are opposite in sign, the points are on opposite sides of the line.

## Example 3

Find the equations of the two lines which are parallel to the line $3 x-4 y-1=0$ and 3 units from it.

The equation of any line parallel to $3 x-4 y-1=0$ has the form $3 x-4 y+k=0$. $\left(0,-\frac{1}{4}\right)$ is a point on the line $3 x-4 y-1=0$.
The distance from $\left(0,-\frac{1}{4}\right)$ to $3 x-4 y+k=0$ is 3 units.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\Rightarrow \frac{\left|3(0)-4\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right)+k\right|}{\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}}=3 & \\
\Rightarrow \frac{|1+k|}{5}=3 & |x|=3 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{1+k}{5}= \pm 3 & \Rightarrow x= \pm 3 \\
& \Rightarrow k=14 \text { or } k=-16
\end{array}
$$

The equations of the lines are

$$
3 x-4 y+14=0 \quad \text { or } \quad 3 x-4 y-16=0

## Section 4.7 The angle between two lines

The diagram shows two lines $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-169.jpg?height=388&width=517&top_left_y=306&top_left_x=661)

Let the slope of $l_{1}$ be $m_{1}$.

$$
\Rightarrow m_{1}=\tan \alpha
$$

Let the slope of $l_{2}$ be $m_{2}$.

$$
\Rightarrow m_{2}=\tan \beta
$$

The angle, $\theta$, between the lines is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta & =\alpha-\beta \\
\tan \theta & =\tan (\alpha-\beta) \\
& =\frac{\tan \alpha-\tan \beta}{1+\tan \alpha \tan \beta} \\
\Rightarrow \tan \theta & =\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{1+m_{1} m_{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The second angle between $l_{1}$ and and $l_{2}$ is $\left(180^{\circ}-\theta\right)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tan \left(180^{\circ}-\theta\right) & =-\tan \theta \\
& =-\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{1+m_{1} m_{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the angle between $l$, and $l_{2}$ may be acute or obtuse, we generally define the angle as shown on the right.

$$
\tan \theta= \pm \frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{1+m_{1} m_{2}}
$$

Note: In practice we generally use $\tan \theta=\left|\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{1+m_{1} m_{2}}\right|$ to find the acute angle, $\theta$, between two lines.

The obtuse angle is obtained by finding $180^{\circ}-\theta$.

## Example 1

Find the acute angle between the lines $y=2 x+5$ and $3 x+y=7$.
Let the slope of $y=2 x+5$ be $m_{1} \Rightarrow m_{1}=2$
Let the slope of $3 x+y=7$ be $m_{2} \Rightarrow m_{2}=-3$
Let $\theta$ be the angle between the lines.

$$
\tan \theta=\left|\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{1+m_{1} m_{2}}\right|=\left|\frac{2-(-3)}{1+2(-3)}\right|=\left|\frac{2+3}{1-6}\right|=\left|\frac{5}{-5}\right|=|-1|=1
$$

$\tan \theta=1 \Rightarrow \theta=45^{\circ}$ is the acute angle.
Note: the obtuse angle is $180^{\circ}-45^{\circ}=135^{\circ}$.

## More difficult problems

A particular type of problem in coordinate geometry involves finding the equations of two lines through a given point and which make angles of $45^{\circ}$, for example, with a given line.

From the given diagram we can see that there are 2 lines through P which make angles of $45^{\circ}$ with the line $l$.

To find the equations of the required lines, we start with the formula
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-170.jpg?height=350&width=401&top_left_y=193&top_left_x=1228)

$$
\tan \theta= \pm \frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{1+m_{1} m_{2}}
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the line required and the given line and $m_{1}$ is the slope of the given line.

By solving the equation using the $\pm$ signs, we get two values for $m_{2}$.

## Example 2

Find the equations of the two lines through the point $(2,3)$ which make angles of $45^{\circ}$ with the line $x-2 y=1$.

Let $m_{1}$ be the slope of the given line $x-2 y=1$.

$$
\Rightarrow m_{1}=\frac{1}{2}
$$

Let $m_{2}$ be the slope of the required line.
The angle between the two lines is $45^{\circ}$.
Using the formula $\tan \theta= \pm \frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{1+m_{1} m_{2}}$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \tan 45^{\circ}= \pm \frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{1+m_{1} m_{2}} \\
& \Rightarrow 1= \pm \frac{\frac{1}{2}-m_{2}}{1+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) m_{2}} \Rightarrow c \\
& \Rightarrow 2+m_{2}=1-2 m_{2}
\end{aligned} \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { or } \\
\Rightarrow & 2+m_{2}=-\left(1-2 m_{2}\right) \\
\Rightarrow 3 m_{2}=-1 & \text { or }
\end{aligned} \quad \begin{array}{ll}
2+m_{2}=-1+2 m_{2} \\
\Rightarrow m_{2}=-\frac{1}{3} & \Rightarrow m_{2}=3
\end{array}
$$

Taking these two values of the slope and the point $(2,3)$ we get these equations

$$
\begin{array}{rlrlrl}
\boldsymbol{m}_{2}=-\frac{1}{3}: & y-y_{1} & =m\left(x-x_{1}\right) & \boldsymbol{m}_{2}=\mathbf{3}: & y-y_{1} & =m\left(x-x_{1}\right) \\
y-3 & =-\frac{1}{3}(x-2) & & y-3 & =3(x-2) \\
3 y-9 & =-x+2 & \text { i.e } & & 3 x-y-3 & =0 \\
\text { i.e. } x+3 y-11 & =0 & & &
\end{array}
$$

$\therefore x+3 y-11=0$ and $3 x-y-3=0$ are the required lines.

(i) $x+2 y+4=0$ and $x-3 y+2=0$

## Section 4.8 Using linear relationships to solve problems

In this section we will illustrate the importance of the straight line when the relationship between two variables is plotted on a graph. In many scientific experiments when the relationship between two sets of data is displayed graphically, the points often lie on, or very close to, a straight line.

This line is generally referred to as the line of best fit.
We will deal more fully with this line in another part of our course.
In this section we will deal only with straight-line graphs and show how useful they can be in the world of science and business.

## Example 1

A spring has an unstretched length of 10 cm . When it is hung with a load of 80 g attached, the stretch length is 28 cm . Assuming that the extension of the spring is proportional to the load,
(i) draw a graph of extension E against load L .
(Put load L on the horizontal axis.)
(ii) find the equation of the line you have drawn in terms of L and E .
(iii) use your graph to find the load required to extend the spring to a length of 20 cm .

This particular spring passes its elastic limit when it is stretched to four times its original length. (This means that if it is stretched more than that it will not return to its original length.)
(iv) Find the load which would cause this to happen.
(i) Two points on the line are $(0,10)$ and $(80,28)$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-172.jpg?height=626&width=940&top_left_y=1172&top_left_x=447)
(ii) The line contains the points $(0,10)$ and $(80,28)$

Slope $=\frac{28-10}{80-0}=\frac{18}{80}=\frac{9}{40}$
Equation of line: $y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right) \quad$ Here L replaces $x$ and E replaces $y$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{E}-10 & =\frac{9}{40}(\mathrm{~L}-0) \\
\Rightarrow \quad 40 \mathrm{E}-400 & =9 \mathrm{~L} \\
\Rightarrow \quad 9 \mathrm{~L}-40 \mathrm{E}+400 & =0 \text { is the required equation }
\end{aligned}
$$

(iii) From the graph it can be seen that a load of 44 grams is required to extend the spring to a length of 20 cm .
(iv) A load of 133 grams is required for the elastic limit of 40 cm to be reached.

## 1. The fundamental principle of counting

The diagram below shows three towns $A, B$ and $C$.
There are 2 roads from $A$ to $B$ and 3 roads from $B$ to $C$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-179.jpg?height=223&width=1005&top_left_y=1150&top_left_x=417)

The number of ways a person can travel from $A$ to $C$ is 6 . These are listed as follows:

$$
(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5) .
$$

This illustrates that there are 2 ways of going from $A$ to $B$ and for each way of going from $A$ to $B$, there are 3 ways of going from $B$ to $C$.
Thus there are $3 \times 2=6$ ways of going from $A$ to $C$.
Similarly, if a car manufacturer produces 5 different models of a car and each model comes in 4 different colours, then a customer has $5 \times 4$ i.e. 20 different ways in which he can select a car.

These examples illustrate what is generally referred to as the Fundamental Principle of Counting which can be stated as follows:

Fundamental
Principle of Counting

If one task can be accomplished in $m$ ways and following this a second task can be accomplished in $n$ ways, then the first task followed by the second task can be accomplished in $m \times n$ ways.

## Example 1

From the given number of names and surnames, determine how many different name-surname pairs are possible.

There are 6 names and for each of these, there are 5 surnames.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Number of possible different pairs } & =6 \times 5 \\
& =30
\end{aligned}
$$

| Name | Surname |
| :---: | :---: |
| Mary | Mooney |
| Jennifer | Byrne |
| Cormac | O'Brien |
| Kate | Lawiski |
| Barry |  |
| Shane | McCarthy |

Note: The Fundamental Principle of Counting can be extended to any number of tasks. For example, if there are 3 roads from $A$ to $B, 2$ roads from $B$ to $C$ and 4 roads from $C$ to $D$, then there are $3 \times 2 \times 4$ i.e. 24 ways of going from $A$ to $D$.

## 2. Permutations

A permutation is an arrangement of a number of objects in a certain order.
If the letters $A, B$ and $C$ are written in a row, one after another, there are 6 possible arrangements as follows:
ABC ACB BAC BCA CAB CBA

Each arrangement is called a permutation; so there are 6 different permutations possible.
When calculating the number of permutations that can be made from a number of items, it is convenient to use "boxes", and working from the left, write down the number of ways in which each box can be filled.

Again, returning to the permutations of the letters $A, B$ and $C$.
The first letter can be selected in 3 different ways.
Once the first place has been filled, there are only two letters left to choose from.
Thus the second place can be filled in 2 ways.
Similarly the third place can be filled in 1 way only.
Thus the letters $A, B$ and $C$ can be arranged in

$$
\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}
\hline 3 & 2 & 1=3 \times 2 \times 1=6 \text { ways } \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

## 3. Factorial notation

To represent $3 \times 2 \times 1$, we write 3!, pronounced "three factorial".
Similarly, $8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1=8$ !
In general, the product of all natural numbers from any number, $n$, down to 1 is called $n$ factorial, and written as $n!$.

## Definition

$n!$ is the number of permutations of $n$ different objects when all the objects are included in each arrangement.

Thus (i) 5 different objects can be arranged in 5! i.e. 120 ways
(ii) 8 different objects can be arranged in 8! i.e. 40320 ways.

## Example 2

There are 6 different books, including a science book, on a shelf.
(i) In how many different ways can the 6 books be arranged on the shelf?
(ii) In how many ways can the 6 books be arranged if the science book is always on the extreme left?
(i) The number of permutations of 6 different books is 6 !

$$
6!=6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1=720
$$

(ii) If we use "boxes", it is clear that the box on the extreme left can be filled in 1 way only (i.e. with the science book).

$$
\begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline 1 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The next box can be filled in 5 ways, the next in 4 ways and so on.
$\therefore$ the number of permutations is $1 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$

$$
=120 \text { ways }
$$

## Example 3

In how many ways can the letters of the word SCOTLAND be arranged in a line?
(i) In how many of these arrangements do the two vowels come together?
(ii) How many of the arrangements begin with S and end with the two vowels?

The letters of the word SCOTLAND can be arranged in 8 ! ways.

$$
8!=8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1=40320 \text { ways }
$$

(i) If the two vowels come together, we treat them as one 'unit'.

$$
\square \square \square \underline{\mathrm{A}} \square \square \square \square
$$

There are now seven 'units' (or boxes) and these can be arranged in $7!$ ways, i.e., 5040 ways. For each arrangement of these seven boxes, the box containing AO can be arranged in 2 ! ways.
$\therefore$ the number of arrangements is $7!\times 2$ !

$$
=5040 \times 2=10080 \text { ways }
$$

(ii) Arrangements beginning with S and ending with AO or OA :

$$
\mathrm{S} \square \square \square \square \square \square \mathrm{AO}
$$

The S is fixed and we treat AO as one 'unit' and that is also fixed.
The remaining 5 letters can be arranged in 5 ! ways.
For each of these arrangements, AO can be arranged in 2 ! ways.
$\therefore$ the number of arrangements is $5!\times 2$ !

$$
=120 \times 2=240
$$

## Example 4

How many four-digit numbers can be formed using the digits $0,2,5,7,8$ if a digit cannot be used more than once in any number?
(i) How many of these numbers are greater than 5000 ?
(ii) How many of these numbers are odd?

Using boxes for the digits, the first box can be filled in 4 ways as 0 cannot be used as a first digit.

| 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

The second box can also be filled in 4 ways as one digit is used but the zero can now be used.
The third box can be filled in 3 ways and the fourth in 2 ways.
$\therefore$ the number of numbers is $4 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2=96$
(i) If a number is greater than 5000 , the first digit must be either 5,7 or 8 .

Therefore the first box can be filled in 3 ways.

$$
\begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline 3 & 4 & 3 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The remaining boxes can be filled in 4,3 and 2 ways.
$\therefore$ the number of numbers is $3 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2=72$
(ii) If one of these numbers is odd, it must end with 5 or 7.

Therefore the last box can be filled in 2 ways only.

$$
\begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

We then go to the first box and, as either 5 or 7 is used and zero cannot be used, this box can be filled in 3 ways.
The zero can now be used and 2 digits are already used, so the second and third boxes can be filled in 3 and 2 ways.
$\therefore$ the number of 4-digit odd numbers is $3 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2=36$

## 4. Permutations of $\boldsymbol{n}$ different objects taking $\boldsymbol{r}$ of them at a time

To find the number of ways the five letters $A, B, C, D, E$ can be arranged in a line when taking 3 at a time, we could use boxes as follows:

$$
5,4,3=5 \times 4 \times 3=60 \text { ways. }
$$

The first box can be filled in 5 ways, the second in 4 ways and the third in 3 ways.
Notice that $5 \times 4 \times 3=\frac{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{2 \times 1}=\frac{5!}{2!}=\frac{5!}{(5-3)!}$

We use the notation ${ }^{5} \boldsymbol{P}_{3}$ to denote the number of permutations of 5 objects, taking them 3 at a time.
${ }^{5} P_{3}=5 \times 4 \times 3 \ldots$ starting at 5 and going down 3 numbers
Similarly, ${ }^{8} P_{4}=8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5\left(\right.$ or $\left.\frac{8!}{(8-4)!}\right)$

In general, the number of arrangements of $n$ objects, taking $r$ at a time, is given on the right.

$$
{ }^{n} P_{r}=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$

## Example 5

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { (i) Evaluate }{ }^{10} \mathrm{P}_{3} \quad \text { (ii) Find } n \text { if } 7\left[{ }^{n} P_{3}\right]=6\left[{ }^{n+1} P_{3}\right] \\
& \text { (i) }{ }^{10} \mathrm{P}_{3}=10 \times 9 \times 8=720 \\
& \text { (ii) } 7\left[{ }^{n} P_{3}\right]=6\left[{ }^{n+1} P_{3}\right] \Rightarrow 7 n(n-1)(n-2)=6(n+1)(n)(n-1) \\
& \Rightarrow 7(n-2)=6(n+1) \\
& \Rightarrow 7 n-14=6 n+6 \\
& \Rightarrow n=20
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 6

How many different four-letter arrangements can be made from the letters of the word THURSDAY if a letter cannot be repeated in an arrangement?
How many of the arrangements begin with the letter D and end with a vowel?
There are 8 letters in THURSDAY.
The number of four-letter arrangements $={ }^{8} \mathbf{P}_{4}=8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5$

$$
=1680
$$

To find the number of arrangements that begin with D and end with a vowel, we will use 'boxes'.

$$
\begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline D & 6 & 5 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The first box can be filled in one way only, i.e. with $D$.
The last box can be filled in 2 ways, i.e., U or A .
Having used two letters, the remaining two boxes can be filled in 6 and 5 ways.
$\therefore$ the number of arrangements $=1 \times 6 \times 5 \times 2$

$$
=60 \text { ways }
$$

## Section 5.2 Combinations

A combination is a selection of objects chosen from a given set.
When we select, for example, three letters from $A, B, C, D$ and $E$, then the combination $A B C$ is the same as the combination $B C A$.
Thus in combinations, unlike permutations, the order is not important.
We use the notation $\binom{7}{3}$ to denote the number of ways in which three objects can be chosen from seven different objects.

The value of $\binom{7}{3}=\frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} \ldots$ start at 7 and go down 3 factors

$$
=\frac{210}{6}=35
$$

Similarly (i) $\binom{8}{4}=\frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}=70$
(ii) $\binom{10}{3}=\frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1}=120$

In general, $\binom{n}{r}=\frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \ldots(n-r+1)}{r!}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$

Combinations
The number of combinations of $r$ objects, chosen from a set of $n$ different objects, is denoted by $\binom{n}{r}$ where

$$
\binom{n}{r}=\frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \ldots(n-r+1)}{r!}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$

Again $\binom{10}{6}=\frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} \rightarrow$ start at 10 and go down 6 factors

$$
=210
$$

Also $\binom{10}{4}=\frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}=210$
This shows that $\binom{10}{6}=\binom{10}{4}$ i.e. $\binom{10}{6}=\binom{10}{10-6}$
In general, it can be shown that $\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n}{n-r}$ as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\binom{n}{r}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \text { and }\binom{n}{n-r} & =\frac{n!}{(n-r)![n-(n-r)]!} \\
& =\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n}{n-r}
\end{aligned}
$$

Also since $\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n}{n-r} \Rightarrow\binom{n}{n}=\binom{n}{n-n}=\binom{n}{0}=1$

$$
\Rightarrow \quad\binom{n}{n}=\binom{n}{0}=1
$$

The fact that $\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n}{n-r}$ is very useful for shortening the calculation involved in evaluating $\binom{16}{12}$, for example.

$$
\binom{16}{12}=\binom{16}{16-12}=\binom{16}{4}=\frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}=1820
$$

Note: $\binom{n}{r}$ may also be written as ${ }^{n} C_{r}$.
The notation $n C r$ is generally used on calculators.
To find $\binom{16}{12}$ on your calculator, key in

$$
16 \text { Shift } n C r \mid 12=\text { The result is } 1820 \text {. }
$$

## Example 1

(i) In how many ways can a team of 5 players be chosen from 9 players?
(ii) In how many ways can this be done if a certain player must be selected in each team?
(i) 5 players can be selected from 9 players in $\binom{9}{5}$ ways.

$$
\binom{9}{5}=\binom{9}{4}=\frac{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}=126
$$

(ii) If a certain player must be included, this results in 4 players being selected from the remaining 8 .
4 players can be selected from 8 in $\binom{8}{4}$ ways.

$$
\binom{8}{4}=\frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}=70
$$

## Example 2

In how many ways can a group of five be selected from ten people?
In how many ways can this group be selected if two particular people cannot both be selected for the group.

Five people can be selected from ten in $\binom{10}{5}$ ways.

$$
=\frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}=252 \text { ways }
$$

If two particular people cannot be in the same group, we find
(i) the total number of ways 5 people can be selected from 10, i.e., 252, from above
(ii) the number of ways the group can be selected if the two people are always included.

If the 2 people are in each group, the number of ways is

$$
\binom{8}{3}=\frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1}=56 \ldots \text { select } 3 \text { from } 8
$$

Therefore the number of ways the group can be selected if the two people cannot be in the same group is (i) less (ii).
$\therefore$ the number is $252-56=196$ ways

## Combinations from two different sets

If we have two different sets, one containing $m$ different things and the other containing $n$ different things, the number of combinations which can be made containing $r$ of the first and $s$ of the second is,

$$
\binom{m}{r} \times\binom{ n}{s}
$$

The selections of $\binom{m}{r}$ and $\binom{n}{s}$ are multiplied because for each selection from $\binom{m}{r}$ we can associate every selection from $\binom{n}{s}$.

## Example 3

Find the number of ways in which a panel of four men and three women can be chosen from seven men and five women.

4 men can be selected from 7 men in $\binom{7}{4}$ ways.
3 women can be selected from 5 women in $\binom{5}{3}$ ways.
With each of the $\binom{7}{4}$ selections, we may associate one of the $\binom{5}{3}$ selections.
$\Rightarrow$ the panel can be selected in $\binom{7}{4} \times\binom{ 5}{3}$ ways

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =35 \times 10 \\
& =350 \text { ways }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 4

In how many ways can a committee of six be formed from 5 teachers and 8 students if there are to be more teachers than students on each committee?

If there are more teachers than students on each committee, the committee will consist of either of the following combinations:
(i) 4 teachers and 2 students
(ii) 5 teachers and 1 student
(i) 4 teachers and 2 students can be selected in $\binom{5}{4} \times\binom{ 8}{2}$ ways

$$
=5 \times 28=140 \text { ways }
$$

(ii) 5 teachers and 1 student can be selected in $\binom{5}{5} \times\binom{ 8}{1}$ ways

$$
=1 \times 8=8 \text { ways }
$$

The total number of possible committees is $140+8$

$$
=148 \text { committees }
$$

Note: In example 4 above, the committee could consist of combinations (i) or (ii).
Notice that these results were added.
In general, when dealing with problems involving permutations, combinations or probability, the word or indicates that results are added.

## Section 5.3 Elementary probability

Probability uses numbers to tell us how likely something is to happen.
The probability or chance of something happening can be described by using words such as:
Impossible Unlikely Even Chance Likely Certain
An event which is certain to happen has a probability of $\mathbf{1}$.

An event which cannot happen has a probability of $\mathbf{0}$.
All other probabilities will be a number greater than 0 and less than 1 .
The more likely an event is to happen, the closer the probability is to 1 .
The line shown below is called a probability scale.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-192.jpg?height=131&width=1121&top_left_y=444&top_left_x=359)

Before you start a certain game, you must throw a die and get a 6 .
The act of throwing a die is called a trial.
The numbers $1,2,3,4,5$ and 6 are all the possible outcomes of the trial.
The required result is called an event.
If you require an even number when throwing a die, then the event or successful outcomes are the numbers 2,4 and 6 .

The result we want is called an event.

The chance of getting a red with this spinner is the same as the chance of getting a blue. Getting a red and getting a blue are equally likely.

In general, if $E$ represents an event, the probability of $E$ occurring, denoted by $P(E)$, is given below:

$$
P(E)=\frac{\text { number of successful outcomes in } E}{\text { number of possible outcomes }}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-192.jpg?height=327&width=236&top_left_y=1074&top_left_x=1372)

Note: 1. The probability of any event $E$ cannot be less than 0 or greater than 1 , i.e., $0 \leqslant P(E) \leqslant 1$.
2. The probability of a certainty is 1 .
3. The probability of an impossibility is 0 .
4. If $E$ is an event, then the probability that $E$ does not occur is 1 minus the probability that $E$ occurs.
This is written as $\boldsymbol{P}(\boldsymbol{E}$ not occurring $)=\mathbf{1}-\boldsymbol{P}(\boldsymbol{E})$.

If $A$ is an event, it will happen or not happen.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A \text { happening }) & =1-P(A \text { not happening }) \\
P(A) & =1-P\left(A^{\prime}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-192.jpg?height=300&width=329&top_left_y=1830&top_left_x=1245)

## Example 1

If a card is drawn from a pack of 52, find the probability that it is
(i) an ace
(ii) a diamond
(iii) a red card.
(i) There are 4 aces in the pack $\Rightarrow P($ ace $)=\frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{13}$
(ii) There are 13 diamonds in the pack $\Rightarrow P($ diamond $)=\frac{13}{52}=\frac{1}{4}$
(iii) There are 26 red cards in the pack $\Rightarrow P($ red card $)=\frac{26}{52}=\frac{1}{2}$

## Example 2

A letter is selected at random from the letters of the word STATISTICS. Find the probability that the letter is
(i) C
(ii) S
(iii) S or T
(iv) a vowel.

There are 10 letters in the word STATISTICS.
(i) There is just one C .
(ii) There are 3 Ss.
$\Rightarrow P(\mathrm{C})=\frac{1}{10}$ $\Rightarrow P(\mathrm{~S})=\frac{3}{10}$
(iii) There are 3 Ss and 3 Ts , i.e. 6 altogether
$\Rightarrow P(\mathrm{~S}$ or T$)=\frac{6}{10}=\frac{3}{5}$
(iv) There is one A and two Is in the word, i.e., 3 vowels.
$\Rightarrow P($ vowel $)=\frac{3}{10}$

## Two events - use of sample spaces

When two coins are tossed, the set of possible outcomes is

$$
\{H H, H T, T H, T T\}, \text { where } H=\text { head and } T=\text { tail. }
$$

This set of possible outcomes is called a sample space.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-193.jpg?height=189&width=383&top_left_y=1551&top_left_x=1230)

By using this sample space, we can write down the probability of getting 2 heads, for example.

$$
P(H H)=\frac{1}{4} \quad \text { and } \quad P(\text { one head and one tail })=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}
$$

In an experiment such as throwing two dice, for example, the construction of a sample space showing all the possible outcomes can assist in finding the probability of a given event.

## Example 3

If two dice are thrown and the scores are added, set out a sample space giving all the possible outcomes. Find the probability that
(i) the total is exactly 7
(ii) the total is 4 or less
(iii) the total is 11 or more
(iv) the total is a multiple of 5 .

The sample space is set out on the right.
There are 36 outcomes.
(i) There are 6 totals of 7 .
$\Rightarrow P(7)=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}$
(ii) There are 6 totals of 4 or less.
$\Rightarrow P(4$ or less $)=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}$
(iii) There are 3 totals of 11 or more.
$\Rightarrow P(11$ or more $)=\frac{3}{36}=\frac{1}{12}$
(iv) The multiples of 5 are 5 and 10 . There are 7 totals of 5 or 10 .
$\Rightarrow P($ multiple of 5$)=\frac{7}{36}$

|  | $\mathbf{1}$ | $\mathbf{2}$ | $\mathbf{3}$ | $\mathbf{4}$ | $\mathbf{5}$ | $\mathbf{6}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\mathbf{1}$ | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| $\mathbf{2}$ | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| $\mathbf{3}$ | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| $\mathbf{4}$ | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| $\mathbf{5}$ | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |
| $\mathbf{6}$ | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |

(i) You will score 10 in a single throw of a normal die.
(ii) It will rain in Ireland sometime in the next week.
(iii) You will win a prize in the club lottery with a single ticket.

## Section 5.4 Experimental probability - Relative frequency

In the previous section, we calculated probabilities on the basis that all outcomes are equally likely to happen. However in real-life situations, events are not always equally likely. For example, the probability of a football team winning a game, or the probability that the next car that passes the school gate will be coloured red, can only be estimated by analysing previous results or carrying out an experiment or survey.

## Experiment

John suspects that a coin is biased. In an experiment, he tossed the coin 200 times and recorded the number of heads after 10, 50, 100, 150 and 200 tosses.

The results are shown in the table on the right:
As the number of tosses increase, the number of heads divided by the number of tosses gets closer to 0.5 , i.e., $\frac{1}{2}$.

This value is called relative frequency and it gives an estimate of the probability that the event will happen.

| Number <br> of tosses | Number <br> of heads | Heads $\div$ <br> tosses |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 10 | 7 | 0.7 |
| 50 | 28 | 0.56 |
| 100 | 53 | 0.53 |
| 150 | 78 | 0.52 |
| 200 | 103 | 0.515 |

Thus an estimate of the probability that an event will occur, by carrying out a survey or experiment, is given by

$$
\text { Relative frequency }=\frac{\text { Number of successful trials }}{\text { Total number of trials }}
$$

In general, as the number of trials or experiments increases, the value of the relative frequency gets closer to the true or theoretical probability.

## Example 1

Dara collected data on the colours of cars passing the school gate.
His results are shown on the table below.

| Colour | White | Red | Black | Blue | Green | Other |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Frequency | 24 | 32 | 14 | 16 | 10 | 4 |

(i) How many cars did Dara survey?
(ii) What was the relative frequency of blue cars?
(iii) What was the relative frequency of red cars?

Give your answer as a decimal.
(iv) Write down an estimate of the probability that the next car passing the school gate will be green.
(v) How can the estimate for the probability of green cars be made more reliable?
(i) The number of cars in the survey is the sum of the frequencies.

This is 100 cars.
(ii) Relative frequency of blue cars $=\frac{16}{100}=\frac{4}{25}$
(iii) Relative frequency of red cars $=\frac{32}{100}=0.32$
(iv) Probability of next car green $=$ relative frequency of green cars

$$
=\frac{10}{100}=\frac{1}{10}
$$

(v) The estimate for the probability of green cars can be made more reliable by increasing the number of cars observed. Five hundred cars would give a very accurate estimate of the true probability.

## Expected frequency

A bag contains 3 red discs and 2 blue discs.
A disc is chosen at random from the bag and replaced.
The probability of getting a blue disc is $\frac{2}{5}$.
This means that, on average, you expect 2 blue discs in every 5 chosen or 20 blue discs in every 50 chosen.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-199.jpg?height=230&width=182&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=1163)

To find the expected number of blue discs when you choose a disc 100 times,
(i) Work out the probability that the event happens once.
(ii) Multiply this probability by the number of times the experiment is carried out.

Thus the expected number of blue discs is

$$
\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{100}{1}=40 .
$$

Expected frequency is probability $\times$ number of trials.

## Example 2

This spinner is biased.
The probability that the spinner will land on each of the numbers 1 to 4 is given in the table below.

| Number | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Probability | 0.35 | 0.1 | 0.25 | 0.15 | $k$ |

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-199.jpg?height=221&width=270&top_left_y=1040&top_left_x=1216)

The spinner is spun once.
(i) Work out the probability, $k$, that the spinner will land on 5 .
(ii) Write down the number on which the spinner is most likely to land.
(iii) If the spinner is spun 200 times, how many times would you expect it to land on 3?
(i) The sum of the probabilities is 1 .

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore 0.35+0.1+0.25+0.15+k=1 \\
& \quad \Rightarrow 0.85+k=1 \\
& \quad \Rightarrow k=1-0.85 \Rightarrow k=0.15
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) The spinner is most likely to land on 1 as it has the highest probability.
(iii) $P(3)=0.25$

Expected frequency of $3=P(3) \times$ number of trials

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =0.25 \times 200 \\
& =50
\end{aligned}
$$

You would expect to land on a three 50 times.

## Section 5.5 Mutually exclusive events - The addition rule

Consider the following two events when drawing a card from a pack of 52 playing cards:

$$
\mathrm{A}=\text { drawing an ace } \quad \mathrm{B}=\text { drawing a king. }
$$

These two events are said to be mutually exclusive as they cannot occur together.
If the events A and B cannot happen together, then

$$
P(\mathbf{A} \text { or } \mathbf{B})=P(\mathbf{A})+P(\mathbf{B})
$$

This is called the addition law for mutually exclusive events.

Events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time.

$$
\text { So } \begin{aligned}
P(\text { draw an ace or king }) & =P(\text { ace })+P(\text { king }) \\
& =\frac{4}{52}+\frac{4}{52} \\
& =\frac{8}{52}=\frac{2}{13}
\end{aligned}
$$

## When events are not mutually exclusive

We will now consider events which may occur at the same time.
If A is the event: selecting an ace from a pack of cards and
$B$ is the event: selecting a heart from a pack of cards
then $P(\mathrm{~A})=\frac{4}{52}$ and $P(\mathrm{~B})=\frac{13}{52}$
In this situation, both events may occur at the same time since the ace of hearts is common to both.
In general, when two events A and B can occur at the same time,

$$
P(\mathrm{~A} \text { or } \mathrm{B})=P(\mathrm{~A})+P(\mathrm{~B})-P(\mathrm{~A} \text { and } \mathrm{B})
$$

Thus in the example given above,

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text { ace or heart }) & =P(\text { ace })+P(\text { heart })-P(\text { ace and heart }) \\
& =\frac{4}{52}+\frac{13}{52}-\frac{1}{52} \\
& =\frac{16}{52}
\end{aligned}
$$

This result can be verified as there are 4 aces and 13 hearts in a pack of cards. Since one of the aces is the ace of hearts, there are 16 aces or hearts in the pack.
i.e. $P($ ace or a heart $)=\frac{16}{52}$, as already found.

## Example 1

A card is drawn at random from a pack of 52.
What is the probability that the card is
(i) a club
(ii) a king
(iii) a club or a king
(iv) a red card
(v) a queen
(vi) a red card or a queen
(i) $P($ club $)=\frac{13}{52}=\frac{1}{4}$
(ii) $P($ king $)=\frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{13}$
(iii) $P($ a club or a king $)=P($ club $)+P($ king $)-P($ club and king $)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{13}{52}+\frac{4}{52}-\frac{1}{52} \\
& =\frac{16}{52}=\frac{4}{13}
\end{aligned}
$$

(iv) $P($ red card $)=\frac{26}{52}=\frac{1}{2}$
(v) $P($ queen $)=\frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{13}$
(vi) $P($ a red card or a queen $)=P($ red card $)+P($ queen $)-P($ red card and queen $)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{26}{52}+\frac{4}{52}-\frac{2}{52} \\
& =\frac{28}{52}=\frac{7}{13}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

A and B are two events such that $P(\mathrm{~A})=\frac{19}{30}, P(\mathrm{~B})=\frac{2}{5}$ and $P(\mathrm{~A} \cup \mathrm{~B})=\frac{4}{5}$. Find $P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})$.

$$
\text { Using } \begin{aligned}
P(A \cup B) & =P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B) \\
\frac{4}{5} & =\frac{19}{30}+\frac{2}{5}-P(A \cap B) \\
P(A \cap B) & =\frac{19}{30}+\frac{2}{5}-\frac{4}{5} \\
& =\frac{19}{30}+\frac{12}{30}-\frac{24}{30} \\
& =\frac{7}{30}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Exhaustive events

Consider these events when throwing a dice:
A: Getting an odd number
B: Getting an even number
These two events contain all the possible outcomes when a dice is thrown.
These events are said to be exhaustive.
If A and B are exhaustive events, then

A set of events is exhaustive if the set contains all possible outcomes.

$$
P(\mathrm{~A})+P(\mathrm{~B})=1 .
$$

## Venn diagrams

A Venn diagram is a useful way to represent data or probabilities.
Each region of a Venn diagram represents a different set of data.
The Venn diagram on the right shows two sets, A and B, in the sample space $S$.

The number of elements in each region is also shown.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-204.jpg?height=286&width=423&top_left_y=1474&top_left_x=1208)

8 is the number of elements in A but not in B .
This is written as A/B.
12 is the number of elements in B but not in A .
This is written as B/A.
6 is the number of elements in $A$ and $B$. This is written as $A \cap B$. 4 is the number of elements in neither $A$ nor $B$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-204.jpg?height=284&width=423&top_left_y=1786&top_left_x=1208)

This is written as $(A \cup B)^{\prime}$.
If information is presented in the form of a Venn diagram, it is easy to write down the probability of different events occurring.

In the diagram on the previous page, the probability of either A or B is given by $P(\mathrm{~A} \cup \mathrm{~B})$.

$$
P(A \cup B)=\frac{8+6+12}{8+6+12+4}=\frac{26}{30}=\frac{13}{15}
$$

(v) Maths or Science or both.
(i) $x=50-(20+12+4)$ i.e. $x=14$

(iii) $P($ neither $)=P(\mathrm{M} \cup \mathrm{S})^{\prime}=\frac{4}{50}=\frac{2}{25}$
(iv) $P($ Science but not Maths $)=\frac{12}{50}=\frac{6}{25}$
(v) $P($ Science or Maths or both $)=\frac{20+14+12}{50}=\frac{46}{50}=\frac{23}{25}$

## Section 5.6 The multiplication law for independent events

Paul spins a coin
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-209.jpg?height=79&width=178&top_left_y=1229&top_left_x=472) and rolls a dice.

His results are shown on the right.
The coin and the die do not affect each other, so their outcomes are independent.

There are 12 equally likely outcomes of the coin and die, as shown in the diagram on the right.

From the sample space, we can see that the probability of a head and a 5 is $\frac{1}{12}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-209.jpg?height=150&width=161&top_left_y=1198&top_left_x=919)

| 6 | H, 6 | Т, 6 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | H, 5 | T,5 |
| Dice 3 | H, 4 | T, 4 |
|  | H, 3 | T, 3 |
| 2 | H, 2 | T, 2 |
|  | H, 1 | T,1 |
|  | H(ead) T(ail) <br> Coin |  |
|  |  |  |

The probability of each outcome can also be found by multiplying the separate probabilities i.e. $P(\mathrm{H})=\frac{1}{2}, P(5)=\frac{1}{6} \therefore P(\mathrm{H}$ and 5$)=\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{12}$
This illustrates the multiplication law of probability which states that for independent events A and B,

$$
P(\mathrm{~A} \text { and } \mathrm{B})=P(A) \times P(\mathrm{~B})
$$

This law is sometimes called the AND Rule.

The multiplication law applies to any number of independent events.
If the events are $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}, \ldots$, then

$$
P(\mathrm{~A} \text { and } \mathrm{B} \text { and } \mathrm{C} \ldots)=P(\mathrm{~A}) \times P(\mathrm{~B}) \times P(\mathrm{C}) \times \ldots
$$

The multiplication law is particularly useful when dealing with problems where one event is followed by another event such as throwing two dice or selecting two or more cards from a pack. The use of the multiplication law eliminates the need to construct a sample space and so significantly reduces the work involved in solving certain problems.

## Example 1

When two dice are thrown, what is the probability of getting
(i) two sixes
(ii) 4 or more on each die?
(i) The probability of getting 6 on the first die is $\frac{1}{6}$.

The probability of getting 6 on the second die is also $\frac{1}{6}$.
$\therefore P(6,6)=\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{36}$
(ii) The probability of getting 4 or more on any die is $\frac{1}{2}$.
$\therefore P(4$ or more on each die $)=\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}$
(Both of these answers could be found by using the sample space for throwing two dice.)

## Example 2

These two spinners are spun. What is the probability that
(i) spinner A shows red
(ii) spinner B shows red
(iii) both spinners show red
(iv) A shows red and B shows blue
(v) both show blue
(vi) both show white
(vii) neither shows white?
(i) $P($ A shows red $)=\frac{1}{6}$
(ii) $P(\mathrm{~B}$ shows red $)=\frac{1}{5}$
(iii) $P($ both show red $)=P($ A red $) \times P(\mathrm{~B}$ red $)$

$$
=\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{5}=\frac{1}{30}
$$

(iv) $P(\mathrm{~A}$ red and B blue $)=P(\mathrm{~A}$ red $) \times P(\mathrm{~B}$ blue $)$

$$
=\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{2}{5}=\frac{2}{30}=\frac{1}{15}
$$

(v) $P($ both blue $)=P($ A blue $) \times \mathrm{P}(\mathrm{B}$ blue $)$

$$
=\frac{2}{6} \times \frac{2}{5}=\frac{4}{30}=\frac{2}{15}
$$

(vi) $P($ both white $)=P($ A white $) \times P(\mathrm{~B}$ white $)$

$$
=\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{5}=\frac{2}{10}=\frac{1}{5}
$$

(vii) $P($ neither shows white $)=P($ A not white $) \times P(\mathrm{~B}$ not white $)$

$$
=\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{5}=\frac{3}{10}
$$

## Example 3

A gambler must throw a 6 with a single dice to win a prize.
Find the probability that he wins at his third attempt.
To win at his third attempt, he must fail at the first, fail at the second and win at the third attempt.
$P($ not throwing a 6 at his first attempt $)=\frac{5}{6}$
$P($ not throwing a 6 at his second attempt $)=\frac{5}{6}$
$P($ throwing a 6 at his third attempt $)=\frac{1}{6}$
$\Rightarrow P($ winning at his third attempt $)=\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{1}{6}=\frac{25}{216}$

## Example 4

Three pupils $A, B$ and $C$ have their birthdays in the same week.
What is the probability that the three birthdays
(i) fall on a Monday
(ii) fall on the same day
(iii) fall on three different days?
(i) $P(A$ 's birthday falls on a Monday $)=\frac{1}{7}$

## Section 5.7 Conditional probability

A box contains 2 red counters and 4 yellow counters, as shown.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-214.jpg?height=84&width=442&top_left_y=255&top_left_x=1189)

One counter is picked at random.
$P($ red $)=\frac{2}{6}$ and $P($ yellow $)=\frac{4}{6}$
Suppose the counter is not put back in the box.
The contents of the box will be different, depending on whether the counter taken out was red or yellow.

If it was red, the box would now contain 1 red and 4 yellow counters, as shown.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-214.jpg?height=93&width=378&top_left_y=599&top_left_x=1077)

If another counter is now taken out at random, the probability that it is red is dependent on the colour of the first counter.

This is called conditional probability.
Returning to the second box above, $P($ red $)$ is now $\frac{1}{5}$.
This probability is calculated on the assumption that a red was got on the first draw.
The box and counters discussed above is an example of a situation where the probability of the second event depends on the outcome of the first event.

If A and B are two events, the conditional probability that A occurs, given that B has already occurred, is written $P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})$.
$P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})$ is read as "the probability of A given B ".
The conditional probability ( $\mathrm{A} \mid \mathrm{B}$ ) is illustrated in the given Venn diagram.

To find $P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})$, the sample space is reduced to B only, since B has already occurred.

Thus $P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})=\frac{\#(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})}{\# \mathrm{~B}}=\frac{P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})}{P(\mathrm{~B})}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-214.jpg?height=338&width=465&top_left_y=1295&top_left_x=1163)

The part of B in which A also occurs is the part denoted by $\mathrm{A} \cap \mathrm{B}$.

$$
\text { Thus } P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})=\frac{\#(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})}{\# \mathrm{~B}}=\frac{P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})}{P(\mathrm{~B})}
$$

Note:

This result should be memorised as it will be used later in our study of probability.

This result can be described in words as follows:
"The probability of A given B is the probability of A and B divided by the probability of B".

A rule known as "The General Multiplication Law" which we will use in book 5.
The result $P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})=\frac{P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})}{P(\mathrm{~B})}$ can be written as

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})=P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B}) \times P(\mathrm{~B}) \ldots \text { multiplying both sides by } P(\mathrm{~B}) . \\
\therefore & P(\mathrm{~B} \cap \mathrm{~A})=P(\mathrm{~B} \mid \mathrm{A}) \times P(\mathrm{~A})=P(\mathrm{~A}) \times P(\mathrm{~B} \mid \mathrm{A}) \\
\therefore & P(\mathbf{A} \cap \mathbf{B})=P(\mathbf{A}) \times P(\mathbf{B} \mid \mathbf{A}) \ldots \text { since } P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})=P(\mathrm{~B} \cap \mathrm{~A}) .
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 1

The numbers 1 to 9 are written on cards and placed in a box.
A card is drawn at random from the box.
Find the probability that the number is prime, given that the number is odd.
The prime numbers up to 9 are $2,3,5,7$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text { prime, given odd number }) & =\frac{\text { number of odd primes }}{\text { number of odd numbers }} \\
& =\frac{3}{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

A bag contains 6 red and 4 blue discs. A disc is drawn from the bag and not replaced. A second disc is then drawn.
Find the probability that
(i) the first two discs are blue
(ii) the second disc drawn is red
(iii) one disc is red and the other disc is blue
(iv) both discs are the same colour.
[The notation $P(R, B)$ represents the probability of red first and blue second.]
(i) $P(1$ st disc is blue $)=\frac{4}{10}$
$P(2$ nd disc is blue $)=\frac{3}{9}$
$\Rightarrow P(B, B)=\frac{4}{10} \times \frac{3}{9}=\frac{12}{90}=\frac{2}{15}$
(ii) For the 2nd disc to be red, we could have
(a) 1st red and 2nd red
or
(b) 1st blue and 2nd red
$P(1$ st red and 2 nd red $)=\frac{6}{10} \times \frac{5}{9}=\frac{30}{90}$
$P(1$ st blue and 2 nd red $)=\frac{4}{10} \times \frac{6}{90}=\frac{24}{90}$
$\Rightarrow P(2$ nd disc red $)=$ sum of probabilities $\frac{30}{90}$ and $\frac{24}{90}$

$$
\frac{30}{90}+\frac{24}{90}=\frac{54}{90}=\frac{6}{10}=\frac{3}{5}
$$

(iii) $P$ (one disc is red and the other blue) is
$P(1$ st red and 2nd blue or 1st blue and 2nd red)
$=P(R, B)+P(B, R)$
$=\left(\frac{6}{10} \times \frac{4}{9}\right)+\left(\frac{4}{10} \times \frac{6}{9}\right)$
$=\frac{24}{90}+\frac{24}{90}=\frac{48}{90}=\frac{8}{15}$
$\therefore P($ one red, one blue $)=\frac{8}{15}$
(iv) $P($ both discs the same colour $)=\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{R}, \mathrm{R})+\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{B}, \mathrm{B})$
$P(R, R)=\frac{6}{10} \times \frac{5}{9}=\frac{30}{90}$
$P(B, B)=\frac{2}{15} \ldots$ from (i) above
$\Rightarrow \mathrm{P}($ both discs the same colour $)=\frac{30}{90}+\frac{2}{15}=\frac{7}{15}$

## Example 3

Use the given Venn diagram to write down
(i) $P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})$
(ii) $P(\mathrm{~B} \mid \mathrm{A})$
(i) $P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})=\frac{P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})}{P(\mathrm{~B})}=\frac{0.1}{0.4}=0.25$
(ii) $P(\mathrm{~B} \mid \mathrm{A})=\frac{P(\mathrm{~B} \cap \mathrm{~A})}{P(\mathrm{~A})}=\frac{0.1}{0.5}=0.2$
[These probabilities could be written
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-216.jpg?height=361&width=510&top_left_y=1168&top_left_x=1030) down directly from the Venn diagram.]

## Example 4

Two events A and B are such that $P(\mathrm{~A})=0.7, P(\mathrm{~B})=0.4$ and $P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})=0.3$. Determine the probability that neither A nor B occurs.

The shaded region is the part of the diagram where neither A nor B occurs.

We use the formula $P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})=\frac{P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})}{P(\mathrm{~B})}$ to find the probability of $\mathrm{A} \cap \mathrm{B}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-216.jpg?height=334&width=517&top_left_y=1870&top_left_x=1024)

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})=\frac{P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})}{P(\mathrm{~B})} & \Rightarrow 0.3=\frac{P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})}{0.4} \\
& \Rightarrow P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})=0.3 \times 0.4=0.12
\end{aligned}
$$

We now fill in the other probabilities in the Venn diagram.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text { neither } A \text { nor } B) & =1-P(A \cup B) \\
& =1-[0.58+0.12+0.28] \\
& =1-0.98=0.02
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 6.1 Angles, triangles and parallelograms

The diagrams shown below will help you recall some of the results you have encountered in your earlier study of geometry.

$a+b+c=180^{\circ}$
Angles which meet at a point on a straight line add up to $180^{\circ}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-227.jpg?height=145&width=272&top_left_y=1163&top_left_x=623)
$a+b=180^{\circ}$
A pair of angles that add together to make $180^{\circ}$ are called supplementary angles.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-227.jpg?height=263&width=279&top_left_y=1104&top_left_x=964)
$a+b+c+d=360^{\circ}$
Angles which meet at a point add up to $360^{\circ}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-227.jpg?height=173&width=272&top_left_y=1149&top_left_x=1307)

When two lines intersect, vertically opposite angles are equal in measure.

Angles formed when a straight line crosses a pair of parallel lines have the following properties:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-227.jpg?height=246&width=333&top_left_y=1702&top_left_x=310)

Corresponding angles are equal.
So $a=b$.
You can find them by looking for an F shape.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-227.jpg?height=220&width=329&top_left_y=1719&top_left_x=769)

Alternate angles are equal. So $a=b$.
Look for a Z shape.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-227.jpg?height=211&width=327&top_left_y=1719&top_left_x=1211)

The interior angles $x$ and $y$ sum to $180^{\circ}$.

$$
x+y=180^{\circ}
$$

## Triangles and their properties

An equilateral triangle has:

- 3 sides equal
- 3 interior angles equal ( $60^{\circ}$ )
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-228.jpg?height=258&width=493&top_left_y=805&top_left_x=416)

The angles of a triangle sum to $180^{\circ}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-228.jpg?height=284&width=197&top_left_y=278&top_left_x=665)

An isosceles triangle has:

- 2 sides equal
- base angles equal
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-228.jpg?height=305&width=159&top_left_y=262&top_left_x=1014)

A right-angled triangle has:

- 1 angle of $90^{\circ}$ $a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}$

Triangles with no equal angles and no equal sides are called scalene triangles.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-228.jpg?height=235&width=465&top_left_y=828&top_left_x=1064)

The exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the interior opposite angles.

## Example 1

In the given triangle, $|A B|=|B C|$, and $|\angle A B E|=56^{\circ}$.
Find (i) $|\angle A C B|$
(ii) $|\angle \mathrm{ACD}|$.
(i) $|\angle \mathrm{ABC}|=180^{\circ}-56^{\circ}=124^{\circ}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& |\angle \mathrm{BAC}|=|\angle \mathrm{BCA}| \ldots \text { isosceles triangle } \\
& \text { But }|\angle \mathrm{BAC}|+|\angle \mathrm{ACB}|=180^{\circ}-124^{\circ}=56^{\circ} \\
& \Rightarrow|\angle \mathrm{ACB}|=28^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-228.jpg?height=255&width=442&top_left_y=1306&top_left_x=1137)
(ii) $|\angle \mathrm{ACB}|+|\angle \mathrm{ACD}|=180^{\circ} \ldots$ straight line

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow|\angle \mathrm{ACD}| & =180^{\circ}-|\angle \mathrm{ACB}| \\
& =180^{\circ}-28^{\circ} \\
\Rightarrow|\angle \mathrm{ACD}| & =152^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Theorem of Pythagoras

Pythagoras was a Greek mathematician and philosopher who lived during the sixth century BC . The theorem that carries his name, the Theorem of Pythagoras, is probably the best known and widelyused theorem in mathematics.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-228.jpg?height=371&width=367&top_left_y=1884&top_left_x=1245)

## Theorem of Pythagoras

In a right-angled triangle, the area of the square drawn on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides.

## Example 2

Calculate the lengths marked $x$ and $y$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^{2} & =3^{2}+4^{2} \\
& =9+16 \\
x & =\sqrt{25} \\
x & =5 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
y^{2}+x^{2}=13^{2}
$$

$$
y^{2}+5^{2}=13^{2}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
y^{2}+25 & =169 \\
y^{2} & =169-25 \\
y & =\sqrt{144} \\
y & =12 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Congruent triangles

Two triangles are congruent to one another if they are equal in all respects i.e. all corresponding sides are equal and all corresponding angles are equal.
It follows that congruent triangles have the same area.
(Note, congruent triangles fit exactly on top of one another)

Triangles are congruent if one of these conditions is true:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-229.jpg?height=284&width=553&top_left_y=1353&top_left_x=273)

Three pairs of sides are equal (SSS).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-229.jpg?height=294&width=546&top_left_y=1699&top_left_x=271)

Two pairs of angles are equal and the sides between them are equal (ASA).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-229.jpg?height=274&width=581&top_left_y=1360&top_left_x=942)

Two pairs of sides are equal and the angles between them (the included angle) are equal (SAS).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-229.jpg?height=206&width=576&top_left_y=1745&top_left_x=944)

Both triangles have a right angle, the hypotenuses are equal and one pair of corresponding sides is equal (RHS).

## Example 3

$A B C$ is a triangle with $|A B|=|A C|$. The bisectors of the angles $B$ and $C$ meet the opposite sides in $D$ and $E$ respectively. Prove that $|B D|=|C E|$.
(It is always advisable to draw a sketch of the information given)
To prove that $|B D|=|E C|$ we need to prove that $\triangle B C E$ is congruent to $\triangle C B D$
Proof:
$|A B|=|A C|$ (given) $\Rightarrow \angle E B C=\angle D C B$
$B D$ and $C E$ are bisectors of $\angle E B C$ and $\angle D C B$ (given)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-230.jpg?height=317&width=364&top_left_y=433&top_left_x=1178)
$\Rightarrow \angle D B C=\angle E C B(\mathrm{~A})$
Also $|B C|=|C B| \quad$ (s)
Therefore the triangles $\triangle B C E$ and $\triangle C B D$ are congruent (ASA)
Therefore the corresponding sides $B D$ and $C E$ have the same length i.e. $|B D|=|C E|$.

## Section 6.2 Theorems involving triangles and parallelograms

## Proofs of theorems

Geometry results or theorems are proved in a formal or structured way by using previously established results and axioms to explain the steps that we take. This method of proving geometric results was first used by a Greek mathematician named Euclid about 300 BC .

The proofs of numerous theorems are contained in his famous book on geometry called Elements. Today, over 2000 years later, we still use Euclid's approach to solve many problems in geometry.

In this section formal proofs of the theorems on your course are given.

These theorems are numberd as in the official syllabus.

An axiom is a statement accepted without proof. The angles in a straight line add to $180^{\circ}$ is an example of an axiom.

A theorem is a statement that can be shown to be true through the use of axioms and logical argument.

You may be asked to reproduce the proofs of theorems 11, 12 and 13 only.

A Corollary is a statement attached to a theorem which has been proven and follows obviously from it.

Note 1. When we are asked to prove something in geometry it is important to give a reason for each deduction made. In a formal proof you must also provide the standard headings of "To prove", "Given", "Construction", "Proof"

Note 2. A converse is where we check if the proposition and conclusion are switched is the statement true.
e.g. In a right-angled triangle, $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$ (where $a, b$ and $c$ are the lengths of the sides and $c$ is the longest side(hypotenuse).

Converse: If $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$ (where $a, b$ and $c$ are the lengths of the sides and $c$ is the longest side (hypotenuse) is the triangle a right-angled triangle? Answer: Yes (the converse is true).
e.g. If it is raining outside then the grass will be wet.

Converse: If the grass is wet is it raining outside? Answer: Not necessarily.

## Angles and sides

The triangle ABC on the right is drawn to scale.
Notice
(i) the largest angle is opposite the longest side
(ii) the smallest angle is opposite the shortest side.

These properties will hold for all triangles and are stated in the theorem below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-234.jpg?height=230&width=444&top_left_y=215&top_left_x=1190)

## Theorem 7

The angle opposite the greater of two sides is greater than the angle opposite the lesser side.

In the triangle on the right, we are given the measures of the three angles.

The converse of the theorem above states that $[\mathrm{BC}]$ is the longest side because it is opposite the greatest angle and [AB] is the shortest side because it is opposite the smallest angle.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-234.jpg?height=260&width=428&top_left_y=707&top_left_x=1205)

## Converse of theorem 7

The side opposite the greater of two angles is longer than the side opposite the lesser angle.

## Triangle inequality

The shortest distance between two points is the line that joins these points.

It follows from this that

$$
|\mathrm{BA}|+|\mathrm{AC}|>|\mathrm{BC}|
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Similarly } & |\mathrm{AB}|+|\mathrm{BC}|>|\mathrm{AC}| \\
\text { and } & |\mathrm{BC}|+|\mathrm{CA}|>|\mathrm{AB}| .
\end{aligned}
$$

## Theorem 8

Two sides of a triangle are together greater than the third side.

## Areas of triangles and parallelograms

The diagrams below show two identical triangles.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-234.jpg?height=323&width=485&top_left_y=1748&top_left_x=243)

$$
\text { Area }=\frac{1}{2}|\mathrm{BC}| \times h_{1}
$$

In this triangle, the base is [BC] and the perpendicular height is $h_{1}$.

$$
\text { Area }=\frac{1}{2}|\mathrm{AB}| \times h_{2}
$$

In this triangle, the base is [AB] and the perpendicular height is $h_{2}$.

Since both triangles are identical, their areas are equal.
The areas were found by using different bases and different perpendicular heights.

This illustrates an important theorem about the area of a triangle, as given on the right.

## Area of a parallelogram

The figure on the right shows a parallelogram ABCD .
In a parallelogram, the opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.

The diagonal [DB] divides the parallelogram into two triangles, ABD and BCD .

These triangles are congruent because the three sides in $\triangle \mathrm{ABD}$ are equal in length to the three sides in $\triangle \mathrm{BCD}$.

Since the triangles are congruent, they are equal in area.

## Theorem 16

For any triangle, base times height does not depend on the choice of the base.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-235.jpg?height=253&width=461&top_left_y=515&top_left_x=1170)

## Theorem 17

A diagonal of a parallelogram bisects the area.

This shows that the diagonal $[\mathrm{DB}]$ bisects the area of the parallelogram ABCD .
In the given parallelogram,

$$
\text { area of } \begin{aligned}
\triangle \mathrm{DCB} & =\frac{1}{2} \times \text { base } \times \text { height } \\
& =\frac{1}{2} \times|\mathrm{DC}| \times h \\
& =\frac{1}{2} b \times h
\end{aligned}
$$

Area of $\mathrm{ABCD}=$ twice area of $\triangle \mathrm{DCB}$.
$\therefore$ Area of $\mathrm{ABCD}=2\left[\frac{1}{2} b \times h\right]$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-235.jpg?height=341&width=517&top_left_y=1065&top_left_x=1118)

$$
=b \times h
$$

## Theorem 18

Area of a parallelogram is the base multiplied by the perpendicular height.

## Example 1

(i) Find the area of the given parallelogram ABCD .
(ii) If $|\mathrm{BC}|=9 \mathrm{~cm}$, find the perpendicular height, $h$, from A to $[\mathrm{BC}]$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-235.jpg?height=314&width=534&top_left_y=1696&top_left_x=1008)
(i) Area of $\mathrm{ABCD}=$ base $\times$ perpendicular height

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =14 \times 8 \\
& =112 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) Area of ABCD is also $|\mathrm{BC}| \times h$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \quad=9 \mathrm{~cm} \times h \\
& =9 h \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \\
& \text { But area of } \mathrm{ABCD}=112 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \quad \ldots \text { from (i) above } \\
& \therefore \quad 9 h=112 \\
& \quad h=\frac{112}{9} \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Problems involving area

The triangles ABC and ABD on the right are equal in area because they have the same base $[A B]$ and they are between the same parallel lines.
The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2}|\mathrm{AB}| \times h$.
Similarly, the parallelograms ABCD and ABEF are equal in area as they have the same base $[\mathrm{AB}]$ and they are between the same parallel lines.

Parallelograms (or triangles) with the same base and between the same parallel lines are equal in area.

## Section 6.3 Ratio theorems

## 1. Transversals

In the given diagram, $l, m$ and $n$ are parallel lines.
The lines $p$ and $q$ are called transversals.
For the transversal $p,|\mathrm{AB}|=|\mathrm{BC}|$.
In this case we say that the parallel lines cut off equal segments on the transversal.

The line, $q$, is another transversal.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-239.jpg?height=343&width=501&top_left_y=1554&top_left_x=1131) It can be shown that the line segments $[\mathrm{DE}]$ and $[\mathrm{EF}]$ are also equal in length.

The same property also holds for all other transversals.

## Theorem 11

If three parallel lines cut off equal segments on some transversal line, then they will cut off equal segments on any other transversal.

Theorem 11 If three parallel lines make segments of equal length on a transversal, then they will also make segments of equal length on any other transversal.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-240.jpg?height=352&width=506&top_left_y=343&top_left_x=810)

Given:
Three parallel lines $l, m$ and $n$ intersecting the transversal $t$ at the points $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$ and E such that $|\mathrm{AC}|=|\mathrm{CE}|$.
Another transversal $k$ intersects the lines at $\mathrm{B}, \mathrm{D}$ and F .
To prove: $\quad|\mathrm{BD}|=|\mathrm{DF}|$.
Construction: Through D draw a line parallel to $t$ intersecting $l$ at X and $n$ at Y .
Proof: $\quad \mathrm{ACDX}$ and CEYD are parallelograms.
$\Rightarrow \quad|\mathrm{AC}|=|\mathrm{XD}|$ and $|\mathrm{CE}|=|\mathrm{DY}| \quad \ldots$ opposite sides
But $|\mathrm{AC}|=|\mathrm{CE}|$.
$\Rightarrow \quad|\mathrm{XD}|=|\mathrm{DY}|$
In the triangles BDX and YDF ,

$$
\begin{aligned}
|\mathrm{XD}| & =|\mathrm{DY}| \\
|\angle \mathrm{BDX}| & =|\angle \mathrm{YDF}| \quad \ldots \text { vertically opposite } \\
|\angle \mathrm{DBX}| & =|\angle \mathrm{DFY}| \quad \ldots \text { alternate angles }
\end{aligned}
$$

$\Rightarrow$ the triangles BDX and YDF are congruent
$\Rightarrow \quad|\mathrm{BD}|=|\mathrm{DF}| \quad \ldots$ corresponding sides of congruent triangles

## 2. Line parallel to a side of a triangle

The diagram on the right shows the side $[A B]$ of the triangle divided into three equal parts.
If lines are drawn through D and E parallel to BC , then the points $X$ and $Y$ will also divide the line $[A C]$ into three equal parts.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-240.jpg?height=331&width=402&top_left_y=1918&top_left_x=207)

In the given triangle, $X$ divides the side $[\mathrm{AB}]$ in the ratio $m: n$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-240.jpg?height=328&width=451&top_left_y=1677&top_left_x=1184)

If [XY] is parallel to [BC], then Y will also divide $[\mathrm{AC}]$ in the ratio $m: n$, as shown.

The diagram above illustrates a very important geometric result which states that:

## Theorem 12

A line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle divides the other two sides in the same ratio.

In a triangle in which $\mathrm{XY} \| \mathrm{BC}$, the following ratios are always true:
(i) $\frac{|\mathrm{AX}|}{|\mathrm{XB}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{AY}|}{|\mathrm{YC}|}$
(ii) $\frac{|\mathrm{AB}|}{|\mathrm{AX}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{ACl}|}{|\mathrm{AY}|}$
(iii) $\frac{|\mathrm{AB}|}{|\mathrm{XB}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{AC}|}{|\mathrm{YC}|}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-241.jpg?height=343&width=371&top_left_y=413&top_left_x=1262)

## Mandatory Proof

## Theorem 12

Let $A B C$ be a triangle. If a line $l$ is parallel to $B C$ and cuts $[A B]$ in the ratio $s: t$, then it also cuts $[A C]$ also in the same ratio.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-241.jpg?height=451&width=644&top_left_y=1010&top_left_x=595)

## Given:

The triangle $A B C$ with $l$ parallel to $[B C]$.
Let $l$ cut $[A B]$ in $D$ in the ratio $s: t \quad \therefore \quad|B D|:|D A|=s: t$
To Prove:
$|C E|:|E A|=s: t$

Construction:
Mark points $D_{0}(=B), D_{1}, D_{2}, \ldots \ldots \ldots D_{s}(=D), D_{s+1}, \ldots \ldots \ldots . . D_{s+t}(=A)$ equally spaced along $[A B]$.
i.e. the segments $\left[D_{0} D_{1}\right],\left[D_{1} D_{2}\right], \ldots \ldots \ldots .\left[D_{s+t-1} D_{s+t}\right]$ all have equal length.
Draw lines $D_{1} E_{1}, D_{2} E_{2}, \ldots .$. parallel BC with $E_{1}, E_{2}, E_{3}, \ldots$. on $[A C]$.

## Proof:

The line segments $\left[C E_{1}\right],\left[E_{1}, E_{2}\right],\left[E_{2}, E_{3}\right], \ldots \ldots . .\left[E_{s+t+1}, D_{s+t}\right]$ all have the same length. ....(theorem 11) and $E_{s}=E$ is the point where $l$ cuts $[A C]$.
Hence $E$ cuts $[A C]$ in the ratio $s: t$.

$$
\begin{equation*}
\therefore \quad|C E|:|E A|=s: t \tag{Q.E.D.}
\end{equation*}
$$

## Example 1

In the given figure, the lines $l, m$ and $n$ are parallel.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-242.jpg?height=332&width=517&top_left_y=322&top_left_x=661)

These three lines divide the transversal $p$ in the ratio $a: b$.
The three lines divide the transversal $q$ in the ratio $a_{1}: b_{1}$.
Prove that $\frac{a}{a_{1}}=\frac{b}{b_{1}}$.
Draw another transversal (in red).
Let this transversal be divided in the ratio $x: y$.
In the blue triangle, the line $m$ is parallel to the base line $n$.

$$
\Rightarrow \quad \frac{a}{b}=\frac{x}{y}
$$

In the yellow triangle, the line $m$ is parallel to the base $l$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-242.jpg?height=366&width=465&top_left_y=854&top_left_x=1116)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad \frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{x}{y} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \frac{a}{b}=\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{x}{y} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \frac{a}{a_{1}}=\frac{b}{b_{1}} \ldots
\end{aligned}
$$

Given $\frac{3}{4}=\frac{6}{8}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{3}{6}=\frac{4}{8}$

## Example 2

In the given triangle, $\mathrm{DE} \| \mathrm{BC}$.
$|\mathrm{AD}|=8, \quad|\mathrm{DB}|=4 \quad$ and $\quad|\mathrm{AC}|=9$.
Find $|\mathrm{AE}|$.
Let $|\mathrm{AE}|=x \Rightarrow|\mathrm{EC}|=9-x$

$$
\frac{|\mathrm{AD}|}{|\mathrm{DB}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{AE}|}{|\mathrm{EC}|}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-242.jpg?height=331&width=478&top_left_y=1645&top_left_x=1067)

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
\Rightarrow \frac{8}{4}=\frac{x}{9-x} & & \Rightarrow & 4 x=8(9-x) \\
& \Rightarrow & 4 x=72-8 x \\
& \Rightarrow & 12 x=72 \\
& \Rightarrow & x=6 \\
& \Rightarrow & |\mathrm{AE}|=6
\end{array}
$$

## 3. Similar triangles

The triangles ABC and DEF shown below have equal angles.
Notice that the triangles have the same shape but different sizes. These triangles are said to be similar or equiangular triangles.
The sides $[\mathrm{AB}]$ and $[\mathrm{DE}]$ are said to be corresponding sides, as they are both opposite the $60^{\circ}$ angle.
Notice that $|\mathrm{DE}|=1 \frac{1}{2}|\mathrm{AB}|$ and $|\mathrm{DF}|=1 \frac{1}{2}|\mathrm{AC}|$.
Similarly $|\mathrm{EF}|$ is $1 \frac{1}{2}|\mathrm{BC}|$.
This illustrates that $\frac{|\mathrm{AB}|}{|\mathrm{DE}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{AC}|}{|\mathrm{DF}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{BC}|}{|\mathrm{EF}|}=\frac{6}{9}=\frac{2}{3}$.
This important result for similar triangles is stated in the theorem below.

## Theorem 13

If two triangles ABC and DEF are similar, then their sides are proportional, in order

$$
\frac{|\mathrm{AB}|}{|\mathrm{DE}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{BC}|}{|\mathrm{EF}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{AC}|}{|\mathrm{DF}|}
$$

Note Two triangles will be similar if two angles in one triangle are equal to two angles in the second triangle. The remaining angles must be equal.

## Theorem 13

If two triangles ABC and DEF are similar, then their sides are proportional in order:

$$
\frac{|\mathrm{AB}|}{|\mathrm{DE}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{BC}|}{|\mathrm{EF}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{AC}|}{|\mathrm{DF}|}
$$

Given:

To Prove:

## Construction:

Proof:

The triangles ABC and DEF , in which

$$
|\angle \mathrm{A}|=|\angle \mathrm{D}|,|\angle \mathrm{B}|=|\angle \mathrm{E}| \text { and }|\angle \mathrm{C}|=|\angle \mathrm{F}| .
$$

$\frac{|\mathrm{AB}|}{|\mathrm{DE}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{BC}|}{|\mathrm{EF}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{AC}|}{|\mathrm{DF}|}$.
Mark the point $X$ on $[A B]$ such that $|A X|=|D E|$.
Mark the point Y on [AC] such that |AY| $=|\mathrm{DF}|$.
Join XY.
The triangles AXY and DEF are congruent ...(SAS)
$\therefore|\angle \mathrm{AXY}|=|\angle \mathrm{DEF}| \quad . .$. corresponding angles
$\therefore \quad|\angle \mathrm{AXY}|=|\angle \mathrm{ABC}|$
$\therefore \mathrm{XY} \| \mathrm{BC}$
$\therefore \quad \frac{|\mathrm{AB}|}{|\mathrm{AX}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{AC}|}{|\mathrm{AY}|} \quad \ldots$ a line parallel to one side divides
$\therefore \frac{|\mathrm{AB}|}{|\mathrm{DE}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{AC}|}{|\mathrm{DF}|}$
Similarly it can be proved that $\frac{|\mathrm{AB}|}{|\mathrm{DE}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{BC}|}{|\mathrm{EF}|}$.
$\therefore \frac{|\mathrm{AB}|}{|\mathrm{DE}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{BC}|}{|\mathrm{EF}|}=\frac{|\mathrm{AC}|}{|\mathrm{DF}|}$.

## Example 3

Find the length of the side marked $x$ in the triangle below.

Corresponding sides are opposite equal angles.
The unmarked angles are equal.

\begin{aligned}
& & \frac{x}{3.5} & =\frac{8}{5} \\
\Rightarrow & & 5 x & =8(3.5) \\
\Rightarrow & & 5 x & =28 \\

## Section 6.4 Circle theorems

In this section we will deal with the geometry of the circle and look at some important mathematical results known as circle theorems.

## Angles in circles

The diagram on the right shows the $\angle \mathrm{AOB}$ at the centre and the $\angle \mathrm{ACB}$ at the circumference of the circle, both standing on the $\operatorname{arc} \mathrm{AB}$.

An important circle theorem states that

## Theorem 19

The angle subtended at the centre of a circle is twice the angle at the circumference.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-249.jpg?height=411&width=336&top_left_y=1652&top_left_x=1310)

The theorem stated above gives rise to two important corollaries:

## Corollary 2

Angles at the circumference on the same arc are equal in measure.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-250.jpg?height=308&width=312&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=1188)
$|\angle \mathrm{ACB}|=|\angle \mathrm{ADB}|$

## Corollary 3

Each angle in a semicircle is a right angle.

## Corollary 4 (The converse of Corollary 3)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-250.jpg?height=281&width=341&top_left_y=595&top_left_x=1164)

If the angle on a chord $[\mathrm{BD}]$ at some point on a circle is a right angle, then $[\mathrm{BD}]$ is a diameter.

## Corollary 5

The sum of the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is $180^{\circ}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-250.jpg?height=312&width=480&top_left_y=947&top_left_x=1151)

## Example 1

In the given diagram, O is the centre of the circle, $|\angle A O B|=110^{\circ}$ and $|\angle O B C|=30^{\circ}$.
Find
(i) $|\angle \mathrm{ACB}|$
(ii) $|\angle \mathrm{OAC}|$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-250.jpg?height=331&width=329&top_left_y=1362&top_left_x=1212)
(i) $|\angle \mathrm{AOB}|=2|\angle \mathrm{ACB}| \ldots$ angle at the centre is double angle at circumference

$$
\begin{array}{lrl}
\Rightarrow & 110^{\circ}=2|\angle \mathrm{ACB}| \\
\Rightarrow & |\angle \mathrm{ACB}| & =\frac{1}{2}\left(110^{\circ}\right)=55^{\circ}
\end{array}
$$

(ii) To find $|\angle \mathrm{OAC}|$, join CO , as shown.

$$
\begin{aligned}
|\angle \mathrm{OBC}| & =|\angle \mathrm{OCB}|=30^{\circ} \ldots|\mathrm{OB}|=|\mathrm{OC}|=\text { radius } \\
|\angle \mathrm{ACB}| & =55^{\circ} \ldots \text { from (i) above } \\
\Rightarrow & |\angle \mathrm{OCA}|=55^{\circ}-30^{\circ}, \text { i.e., } 25^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

But $|\angle \mathrm{OAC}|=|\angle \mathrm{OCA}|$, since $|\mathrm{OA}|=|\mathrm{OC}|=$ radius.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-250.jpg?height=331&width=331&top_left_y=1871&top_left_x=1209)
$\Rightarrow \quad|\angle \mathrm{OAC}|=25^{\circ}$.

## Tangents and chords

A tangent to a circle is a straight line that meets the circle at one point only.

In the given diagram, $\ell$ is a tangent to the circle.
T is called the point of contact.
$[\mathrm{AB}]$ and $[\mathrm{CD}]$ are chords of the circle.
In the given diagram, $[\mathrm{OM}]$ is perpendicular
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-251.jpg?height=354&width=390&top_left_y=238&top_left_x=1168) to the chord $[\mathrm{AB}]$.
$|\mathrm{AM}|=|\mathrm{MB}|$.

## Theorem 21

The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-251.jpg?height=312&width=324&top_left_y=608&top_left_x=1172)

## Example 2

Circle $k$ has a diameter 20 cm in length.
$\mathrm{AB} \perp \mathrm{CD}$ and $|\mathrm{CD}|=16 \mathrm{~cm}$.
Find $|\mathrm{EB}|$.

The diameter $[A B]$ is perpendicular to the chord $[C D]$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad|\mathrm{CE}| & =|\mathrm{ED}|=8 \mathrm{~cm} \\
|\mathrm{OD}| & =10 \mathrm{~cm}=\text { radius }
\end{aligned}
$$

$\triangle \mathrm{ODE}$ is right-angled.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow & 10^{2} & =8^{2}+|\mathrm{OE}|^{2} \\
& \Rightarrow & 100 & =64+|\mathrm{OE}|^{2} \\
& \Rightarrow & |\mathrm{OE}|^{2} & =36 \\
& \Rightarrow & |\mathrm{OE}| & =6 \mathrm{~cm} \\
& \Rightarrow & |\mathrm{~EB}| & =(10-6) \mathrm{cm} \\
& \Rightarrow & |\mathrm{~EB}| & =4 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-251.jpg?height=741&width=354&top_left_y=1045&top_left_x=1191)

The diagram shows a tangent PT to the circle $k$ with centre O . T is the point of contact and $[\mathrm{OT}]$ is a radius.

## $\mathrm{OT} \perp \mathrm{TP}$

This diagram illustrates that the angle between a tangent and a radius is $90^{\circ}$. This result is stated in the theorem below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-251.jpg?height=341&width=390&top_left_y=1850&top_left_x=1243)

## Theorem 20

1. A tangent is perpendicular to the radius that goes to the point of contact.
2. If a point T lies on a circle $k$ and a line TP is perpendicular to the radius to T , then TP is a tangent to $k$.

## Corollary 6

If two circles intersect at one point only, then the two centres and the point of contact are collinear.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-252.jpg?height=315&width=927&top_left_y=630&top_left_x=456)

## Example 3

In the given diagram, PT is a tangent to the circle and $[\mathrm{OT}]$ is a radius.
If $|\angle \mathrm{TOQ}|=120^{\circ}$, find the measures of the angles marked $x$ and $y$.

The triangle OTQ is isosceles as $|\mathrm{OT}|=|\mathrm{OQ}|=$ radius

Since $\mathrm{OT} \perp \mathrm{PT} \Rightarrow|\angle \mathrm{OTP}|=90^{\circ}$

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
\therefore & |\angle \mathrm{OTQ}| & =|\angle \mathrm{OQT}|=x \\
\therefore & & 2 x & =180^{\circ}-120^{\circ} \\
& & =60 \\
x & =30^{\circ} &
\end{array}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-252.jpg?height=348&width=350&top_left_y=1080&top_left_x=1192)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad x+y & =90^{\circ} \\
30+y & =90^{\circ} \quad \ldots x=30^{\circ} \\
y & =90^{\circ}-30^{\circ} \\
y & =60^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Introduction to calculus

In this chapter, we begin the study of a very important branch of mathematics called calculus. Differential calculus is mainly concerned with measuring the rate of change of one quantity with respect to another. For example, the speed of a car is the rate at which the distance it travels changes with respect to time. However, we know that a car is unlikely to travel at a constant speed, even for a short time. If a car is accelerating, it is changing speed by the second. If $60 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ is registered on the speedometer, this tells us the instantaneous speed. Calculus is the mathematical tool that will enable us to find instantaneous rates of change.

## Section 7.1 Average rate of change

We have already learned how to find the slope of a line if we are given two points on the line.
The slope, $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$.
We will now refer to this slope as the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$.

The slope of a line will always be a fixed number as the slope is constant all along the line.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-264.jpg?height=390&width=437&top_left_y=1384&top_left_x=1196)

The curve on the right is the graph of a function $y=f(x)$.
How do we find the slope of a curve?
The slope of a curve at any point is defined as the slope of the tangent to the curve at that point.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-264.jpg?height=430&width=576&top_left_y=1805&top_left_x=1058)

The diagram above also shows tangents drawn at three different points on the curve.
The three tangents have different slopes - $m_{1}, m_{2}$ and $m_{3}$.
In the next section of this chapter, we will show how calculus can be used to find the slope of the tangent to a curve at any point on the curve.

## Average rate of change

The curve on the right is the graph of $f(x)=x^{2}$.
The points $(1,1)(2,4)$ and $(3,9)$ are shown on the curve.
Lines are drawn through $(1,1)$ and $(3,9)$ and also through $(1,1)$ and $(2,4)$.
These lines are marked $l$ and $m$.
Slope of $l=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=\frac{9-1}{3-1}=\frac{8}{2}=4$
Slope of $m=\frac{4-1}{2-1}=\frac{3}{1}=3$
The slope of the line $l$ joining $(1,1)$ and $(3,9)$ is generally referred to as the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-265.jpg?height=607&width=703&top_left_y=451&top_left_x=926) average rate of change.
The average rate of change of the line $m=$ slope of $m=3$.
In general, for any function $y=f(x)$, the average rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$ over the interval $[a, b]$ is the slope of the line joining $(a, f(a))$ to $(b, f(b))$.
Average rate of change $=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$

The interval $[a, b]$ represents $a \leqslant x \leqslant b$.

## Example 1

Find the average rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$ for the function $y=f(x)$ over the interval $[1,4]$ as shown.

The average rate of change $=$ slope $_{A B}$

$$
=\frac{7-1}{4-1}=\frac{6}{3}=2
$$

## Example 2

The temperature $T\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ in a classroom on a particular day can be modelled by the equation

$$
T=\frac{200}{t^{2}+2 t+20}, \text { where } t \text { is the time after } 6.00 \text { p.m.. }
$$

Find (i) the temperature in the room at 6.00 p.m.
(ii) the temperature in the room at midnight
(iii) the average rate of change of temperature from 6.00 p.m. to midnight.
(i) At 6.00 p.m., $t=0$

$$
\Rightarrow T=\frac{200}{(0)^{2}+2(0)+20}=10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

(ii) At midnight, $t=6$

$$
\Rightarrow T=\frac{200}{(6)^{2}+2(6)+20}=2.94^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

(iii) The average rate of change $=\frac{10-2.94}{6-0}=1.18^{\circ} \mathrm{C} /$ hour

## Section 7.2 Limits - Continuity

## Introduction to limits

Consider this sequence of numbers: $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{32}, \frac{1}{64}, \ldots$
If we add the first two numbers, we get $\frac{3}{4}$. If we add the first three, we get $\frac{7}{8}$.
If we add the first six numbers, we get $\frac{63}{64}$.
Notice that the more terms we add, the closer the result gets to 1 but it never reaches 1 .
In mathematics, we say that the limit of the sum of these numbers is 1 .
We will now take the function $f(x)=x^{2}$ and consider its value as $x$ approaches 3 from below and above 3
(1) $f(2)=4 ; f(2.5)=6.25 ; f(2.75)=7.5625 ; f(2.9)=8.41 \ldots$
(2) $f(4)=16 ; f(3.5)=12.25 ; f(3.25)=10.5625 ; f(3.1)=9.61 \ldots$

As $x$ gets closer to 3 , the value of $x^{2}$ gets closer to 9 . 9 is said to be the limit of $f(x)=x^{2}$ as $x$ tends to 3 .

This is written as $\lim _{x \rightarrow 3}\left(\boldsymbol{x}^{2}\right)=\mathbf{9}$.
We generally use the abbreviation lim for limit.
In general, to find the limit of $\underset{x \rightarrow a}{f(x)}$, we substitute $a$ for $x$ in the function.
For example, $\lim _{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{3 x+2}{x+4}=\frac{3(2)+2}{2+4}=\frac{8}{6}=\frac{4}{3}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-268.jpg?height=507&width=510&top_left_y=871&top_left_x=1122)

Now consider $\lim _{x \rightarrow 3} \frac{x^{2}-9}{x-3}$.
When we substitute 3 for $x$, we get $\frac{9-9}{3-3}=\frac{0}{0}$.
The result $\frac{\mathbf{0}}{\mathbf{0}}$ is known as an indeterminate form as

## Limit notation

$\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=p$
states that $f(x)$ approaches $p$ as $x$ gets close to $a$. its value cannot be determined.

If after substitution the result is $\frac{0}{0}$, some other method must be found to obtain the limit.
The most common method used involves factorising the numerator and denominator and then dividing by the common factor.

Thus, $\lim _{x \rightarrow 3} \frac{x^{2}-9}{x-3}=\lim _{x \rightarrow 3} \frac{(x+3)\left(x^{1}-3\right)}{(x-3)}=\lim _{x \rightarrow 3}(x+3)=6$.
Note: It is important to realise that if $f(x)=\frac{x^{2}-9}{x-3}$, then $f(3)$ does not exist, but the $\lim _{x \rightarrow 3}(x)$ does exist.

## Example 1

Evaluate
(i) $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{4 x+1}{2 x+3}$
(ii) $\lim _{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{x^{2}+x-6}{x-2}$.
(i) $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{4 x+1}{2 x+3}=\frac{0+1}{0+3}=\frac{1}{3}$
(ii) $\left[\lim _{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{x^{2}+x-6}{x-2}=\frac{4+2-6}{2-2}=\frac{0}{0} \quad \ldots\right.$ indeterminate $]$

We now factorise the numerator:

$$
\therefore \lim _{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{x^{2}+x-6}{x-2}=\lim _{x \rightarrow 2} \frac{(x+3)\left(x^{1}-2\right)}{\left(\frac{x}{1}-2\right)}=\lim _{x \rightarrow 2}(x+3)=5
$$

## Limit of a function as $x \rightarrow \infty$

In the example above, we investigated the limit of a function as the variable tended to a fixed number. Now we will examine the limit of a function as the variable tends to infinity. We use the symbol $\infty$ to denote infinity.

Now consider $\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$.
When $x=10, \frac{1}{x}=\frac{1}{10}=0.1$. When $x=1000, \frac{1}{x}=\frac{1}{1000}=0.001$.
When $x=1,000,000, \frac{1}{x}=\frac{1}{1,000,000}=0.000001$.
These examples illustrate that as $x$ increases, the value of $\frac{1}{x}$ decreases and in fact tends to zero.

$$
\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{x}=0
$$

If the numerator is any fixed number $k$, the $\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\boldsymbol{k}}{\boldsymbol{x}}$ is also zero.
Since $\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{x}=0$, it follows that $\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{x^{2}}=0$ and $\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{k}{x^{2}}=0$, where $k \in R$.

## Example 2

Evaluate
(i) $\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{4 x+1}{2 x+3}$
(ii) $\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{3 x^{2}-2 x+4}{5 x^{2}+4 x-3}$
(In examples of this type, we divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of $x$ in the expression and then use $\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{x}=0$ or $\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{k}{x}=0$ to evaluate the limit of the function.)
(i) $\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{4 x+1}{2 x+3}=\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{4+\frac{1}{x}}{2+\frac{3}{x}}$

$$
=\frac{4+0}{2+0}=2 \quad \ldots\left(\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{k}{x}=0\right)
$$

(ii) $\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{3 x^{2}-2 x+4}{5 x^{2}+4 x-3}=\lim _{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{3-\frac{2}{x}+\frac{4}{x^{2}}}{5+\frac{4}{x}-\frac{3}{x^{2}}} \quad \ldots$ divide each term by $x^{2}$

$$
=\frac{3-0+0}{5+0-0}=\frac{3}{5}
$$

## Limits and slopes

In the next section on differential calculus, we will be required to find $\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ if we want to find the slope of the tangent to a curve at any point on the curve.

## Example 3

Find $\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ given
(i) $f(x)=4 x-5$
(ii) $f(x)=x^{2}+1$.
(i) $f(x)=4 x-5$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(x+h)=4(x+h)-5 \\
& \begin{aligned}
f(x+h)-f(x) & =4(x+h)-5-(4 x-5) \\
& =4 x+4 h-5-4 x+5 \\
& =4 h
\end{aligned} \\
& \begin{aligned}
\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} & =\frac{4 h}{h}=4
\end{aligned} \\
& \lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} 4=4
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $f(x)=x^{2}+1$
$f(x+h)=(x+h)^{2}+1$
$f(x+h)-f(x)=(x+h)^{2}+1-\left(x^{2}+1\right)$
$=x^{2}+2 x h+h^{2}+1-x^{2}-1$
$=2 x h+h^{2}$
$\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=\frac{2 x h+h^{2}}{h}=2 x+h$
$\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0}(2 x+h)=2 x$

## Continuity

A function $f(x)$ is said to be continuous when $x=a$ if the graph of $y=f(x)$ can be drawn through the point with coordinates $(a, f(a))$ without a break.
Otherwise, there is said to be a discontinuity at $x=a$.
Most of the functions that we encounter on our course are continuous functions.

The graph on the right is continuous as the graph can be traced with no jumps or breaks, that is, the pen does not have to leave the page.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-271.jpg?height=413&width=572&top_left_y=430&top_left_x=1060)

Consider the two graphs shown below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-271.jpg?height=489&width=588&top_left_y=944&top_left_x=333)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-271.jpg?height=518&width=383&top_left_y=915&top_left_x=1122)

On the left above is the graph of the function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x+1}$.
As $x$ approaches -1 from below, the value of the function decreases rapidly.
As $x$ approaches -1 from above, the value of the function increases rapidly.
$f(-1)$ cannot be found as $f(-1)=\frac{1}{-1+1}=\frac{1}{0}$, which is undefined.

We say that the graph is not continuous at $x=-1$.
Notice that the curve approaches but never touches the line $x=-1$.
We say that the line $x=-1$ is an asymptote to the curve.
Similarly, the graph on the right above shows a break at $x=1$.
Again, we say that the curve is not continuous at $x=1$.

Asymptote is a line that a curve approches as the curve and line go to infinity.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-271.jpg?height=456&width=461&top_left_y=1691&top_left_x=1137)

Asymptotes: $x=3, y=2$

A more formal definition of continuity is given below:

A function $f$ is continuous at $x=a$ if $\lim _{x \rightarrow a} f(x)=f(a)$.

## Example 4

Show that $f(x)=\frac{3}{x-3}$ is not continuous at $x=3$.
$f(x)=\frac{3}{x-3} \Rightarrow f(3)=\frac{3}{3-3}=\frac{3}{0}$, which is undefined.
Since $f(3)$ is undefined, a Real value for $f(x)$ does not exist at $x=3$
Therefore, $f(x)$ is not continuous at $x=3$.

The limit of this function should result in an approximate value for $e$.

## Section 7.3 Differentiating from first principles

The graph of the function $y=x^{2}$ is shown.
We could find the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point $(2,4)$ by drawing an accurate curve and tangent and then measure the slope by finding a second point on the tangent. However, this method will give only an estimate, so some other method must be found.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-274.jpg?height=357&width=508&top_left_y=1024&top_left_x=1123)

The method used to find the slope of a tangent to a curve at any point is illustrated by the diagram on the right. If we select points $C$ and $D$ on the $\operatorname{arc} A B$, we notice that the closer the point moves towards $A$, the closer the approximation to the slope of the tangent at $A$.

As the point gets very close to $A$, we say that
the slope of the tangent $=$ the limit of the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-274.jpg?height=439&width=558&top_left_y=1426&top_left_x=1074) slope of the chord as the point approaches $A$.

## Differentiating from first principles

We will now consider the method of finding the slope of the tangent to the curve $y=f(x)$ at any point $\mathrm{A}(x, f(x))$ on the curve.

Let B be another point on the curve such that the $x$-coordinate of B is $x+h$, where $h$ represents a small increase.

Thus, the coordinates of B are

$$
(x+h, f(x+h)) .
$$

From the diagram, the slope of the chord $\mathrm{AB}=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-275.jpg?height=399&width=604&top_left_y=352&top_left_x=1025)

When $h$ becomes very small, the slope of the tangent at A is the limit of the slope of the chord AB as $h \rightarrow 0$.
$\Rightarrow$ the slope of the tangent at $\mathrm{A}=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ $\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$, if it exists, is called the derived function.

We use the notation $\frac{\mathbf{d} \boldsymbol{y}}{\mathbf{d} \boldsymbol{x}}$ (pronounced 'dee $\boldsymbol{y}$ dee $\boldsymbol{x}^{\prime}$ ), or $\boldsymbol{f}^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{x})$ (pronounced ' $f$ dash of $x^{\prime}$ ) to represent the derived function or simply the derivative.

The derived function
In general, for the curve $y=f(x)$,

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}\left(\text { or } f^{\prime}(x)\right)=\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$

represents the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point $(x, y)$ on the curve.

The process of finding the derivative of a function $y=f(x)$ by finding $\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ is called differentiating from first principles.

In the next section of this chapter, we will see that there are basic rules that can be used to reduce the work involved in differentiating from first principles.

Note: When a function is given in the form $f(x)=\ldots$, the derivative is written as $f^{\prime}(x)=\ldots$.
When the function is given in the form $y=\ldots$, the derivative is written in the form $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\ldots$.
For any function $y=f(x), \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ may also be written as $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x}(y)$.
This is pronounced 'the dee dee $x$ of $y$ '.

## Example 1

Differentiate $f(x)=3 x+8$ from first principles.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) & =3 x+8 \\
\frac{f(x+h)}{f(x+h)-f(x)} & =3(x+h)+8 \\
& =3(x+h)+8-3 x-8 \\
& =3 h \\
\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} & =\frac{3 h}{h}=3 \quad \ldots \text { dividing both sides by } h \\
\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} & =\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} 3=3 \\
\therefore \quad f^{\prime}(x)=3 &
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: Since the given function $f(x)=3 x+8$ is linear, we expect the slope $\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}\right)$ to be a constant.

## Example 2

Differentiate $f(x)=x^{2}-6 x$ from first principles.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) & =x^{2}-6 x \\
f(x+h) & =(x+h)^{2}-6(x+h) \\
& =x^{2}+2 h x+h^{2}-6 x-6 h \\
\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{} & =x^{2}+2 h x+h^{2}-6 x-6 h-\left(x^{2}-6 x\right) \\
& =x^{2}+2 h x+h^{2}-6 x-6 h-x^{2}+6 x \\
& =2 h x+h^{2}-6 h \\
\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} & =\frac{2 h x+h^{2}-6 h}{h}=2 x+h-6 \\
\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} & =\lim _{h \rightarrow 0}(2 x+h-6) \\
\therefore \quad f^{\prime}(x)=2 x-6 & =2 x-6
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: Since the graph of $f(x)=x^{2}-6 x$ is a quadratic curve, the slope (rate of change) is not constant and varies as $x$ varies, i.e. ( $2 x-6$ ) varies as $x$ varies.

## Example 3

Find, from first principles, the slope of the tangent to the curve with equation $f(x)=x^{2}+x+5$ at the point where $x=3$.

To get the slope of the tangent, we find $f^{\prime}(x)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) & =x^{2}+x+5 \\
f(x+h) & =(x+h)^{2}+(x+h)+5 \\
& =x^{2}+2 h x+h^{2}+x+h+5 \\
f(x+h)-f(x) & =x^{2}+2 h x+h^{2}+x+h+5-\left(x^{2}+x+5\right) \\
& =x^{2}+2 h x+h^{2}+x+h+5-x^{2}-x-5 \\
& =2 h x+h^{2}+h \\
\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} & =2 x+h+1 \\
\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} & =\lim _{h \rightarrow 0}(2 x+h+1) \\
\therefore \quad & =2 x+1 \\
\therefore \quad f^{\prime}(x)=2 x+1 &
\end{aligned}
$$

When $x=3, f^{\prime}(x)=2(3)+1=7$.
Hence, the slope of the tangent at the point where $x=3$ is 7 .

8. If $f(x)=x^{2}-3 x+1$, find $f^{\prime}(x)$ using first principles. Use your result to find the point on the curve $y=f(x)$ where the slope of the tangent is zero.

## Section 7.4 Differentiation by rule

In the previous section, we found the derivative of a function from first principles.
This method becomes very tedious as the function becomes more complex.
We will now show how certain rules can be used to find the derivative of a function without having to use the method of differentiation from first principles.

It can be shown from first principles that if
(i) $y=x^{2}$, then $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=2 x$
(ii) $y=4 x^{2}$, then $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=8 x$
(iii) $y=x^{3}$, then $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=3 x^{2}$

The pattern in these derivatives suggests a general result which is given below:

## Differentiation by rule

1. If $y=x^{n}$, then $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=n x^{n-1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{R}$.
2. If $y=a x^{n}$, then $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=n a x^{n-1}$

In words, this rule may be expressed as follows:

To differentiate a term containing a power (index) of $x$, multiply the coefficient by the power (index) and reduce the power (index) by 1 .

## Examples

(i) $y=3 x^{2}$
(ii) $y=7 x^{3}$
(iii) $f(x)=5 x$
(iv) $f(x)=6 x^{4}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=6 x$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=21 x^{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x) & =5 x^{0} \\
& =5
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)=24 x^{3}
$$

## The derivative of a constant

Notice that if $y=4$ (a constant), then this can be written as $y=4 x^{0}$. ... (any number to the power of zero is 1 )
Thus, $y=4 x^{0} \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=(0) 4 x^{-1}=0$.
The derivative of a constant is zero.
This shows that the derivative of a constant is zero.
The equation of the line $l$ shown is $y=4$.
The slope of $l$ is zero.
Since $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ represents the slope, the diagram illustrates that the derivative of a constant is zero.

## The derivative of a sum or difference of two functions

If a function $y=f(x)$ consists of more than one term, we differentiate each term in turn to find $f^{\prime}(x)$.

If $f(x)=u(x)+v(x)$, then $f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{\mathrm{d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}+\frac{\mathrm{d} v}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.

## Examples

(i) $y=2 x^{2}+5 x$
(ii) $y=6 x^{3}-3 x^{2}+4$
(iii) $y=2+3 x-6 x^{2}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=4 x+5$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=18 x^{2}-6 x$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=3-12 x$

To differentiate the function $y=\frac{1}{x^{2}}$, we rewrite the function as
$y=x^{-2}$ and so $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=-2 x^{-2-1}=-2 x^{-3}=-\frac{2}{x^{3}} \quad \ldots-2$ reduced by 1 gives -3

## Example 1

Find the derivative of $f(x)=6 x^{3}-3 x^{2}+4 x$.
Hence, find $f^{\prime}(2)$ and interpret the result.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) & =6 x^{3}-3 x^{2}+4 x \\
f^{\prime}(x) & =3\left(6 x^{2}\right)-2(3 x)+4 \\
f^{\prime}(x) & =18 x^{2}-6 x+4 \\
f^{\prime}(2) & =18(2)^{2}-6(2)+4=64 \\
f^{\prime}(2) & =64 \text { states that the slope of the tangent to the curve at } \\
& \text { the point where } x=2 \text { is } 64 .
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

Find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ for each of the following:
(i) $y=3 x^{2}+\frac{2}{x}$
(ii) $y=\sqrt{x}-\frac{4}{x^{2}}$
(i) $y=3 x^{2}+\frac{2}{x}$
(ii) $y=\sqrt{x}-\frac{4}{x^{2}}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad y & =3 x^{2}+2 x^{-1} \\
\frac{d y}{d x} & =6 x-2 x^{-2} \\
\frac{d y}{d x} & =6 x-\frac{2}{x^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow y & =x^{\frac{1}{2}}-4 x^{-2} \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{1}{2} x^{-\frac{1}{2}}+8 x^{-3} \\
& =\frac{1}{2 x^{\frac{1}{2}}}+\frac{8}{x^{3}} \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x}}+\frac{8}{x^{3}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

Find the slope of the tangent to the curve $y=3 x^{2}+4 x-5$ at the point ( 1,2 ). Hence, find the equation of the tangent at this point.

The slope of the tangent is $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y & =3 x^{2}+4 x-5 \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =6 x+4 \\
& =6(1)+4=10 \quad \ldots \text { at the point }(1,2)
\end{aligned}
$$

We now use the formula $y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right)$ to find the equation of the tangent at $(1,2)$.
$\Rightarrow y-2=10(x-1) \quad \ldots$ slope $=10$
$\Rightarrow y-2=10 x-10$
$\Rightarrow 10 x-y-8=0$ is the equation of the tangent.

## Example 4

Find the points on the curve $y=x^{3}-3 x^{2}$ at which the slope of the tangent to the curve is 9 .

$$
\begin{aligned}
y & =x^{3}-3 x^{2} \\
\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =3 x^{2}-6 x \\
& \Rightarrow 3 x^{2}-6 x=9 \quad \ldots \text { since the slope }=9 \\
& \Rightarrow 3 x^{2}-6 x-9=0 \\
& \Rightarrow x^{2}-2 x-3=0 \\
& \Rightarrow(x-3)(x+1)=0 \\
& \Rightarrow x=3 \text { or } x=-1
\end{aligned}
$$

When $x=3, y=(3)^{3}-3(3)^{2}$ i.e. 0
$\Rightarrow(3,0)$ is one point.
When $x=-1, y=(-1)^{3}-3(-1)^{2}$ i.e. -4
$\Rightarrow(-1,-4)$ is the second point.
Therefore the two points are $(3,0)$ and $(-1,-4)$.

## Section 7.5 Product, Quotient and Chain Rules

## 1. The Product Rule

The function $y=(3 x-4)\left(x^{2}+2\right)$ can be differentiated by multiplying out the brackets and then differentiating the product.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Thus, } y=3 x^{3}-4 x^{2}+6 x-8 \\
& \text { and } \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=9 x^{2}-8 x+6
\end{aligned}
$$

When the expansion of brackets becomes too tedious, a product can be differentiated in a much shorter way by using a method generally called the Product Rule.

If $y=u v$, where $u$ and $v$ are both functions of $x$, then
Product Rule

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=u \frac{\mathrm{~d} v}{\mathrm{~d} x}+v \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}
$$

## Example 1

If $y=\left(6 x^{2}+2 x\right)(3 x-2)$, find $\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{~d} y}$.
This is a product in which $\quad u=6 x^{2}+2 x$ and $\quad v=3 x-2$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =u \frac{\mathrm{~d} v}{\mathrm{~d} x}+v \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x} \quad \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}=12 x+2 \quad \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} v}{\mathrm{~d} x}=3 \\
& =\left(6 x^{2}+2 x\right)(3)+(3 x-2)(12 x+2) \\
& =18 x^{2}+6 x+36 x^{2}+6 x-24 x-4 \\
\therefore & \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=54 x^{2}-12 x-4
\end{aligned}
$$

Product Rule in words

When a product consists of 2 factors, i.e. $y=($ first $)($ second $)$, then the product rule may be memorised as follows:
"the first $\times$ by the derivative of the second + the second $\times$ by the derivative of the first".

## 2. The Quotient Rule

When differentiating a function of the form $y=\frac{u}{v}$, where $u$ and $v$ are both functions of $x$, for example $y=\frac{2 x-3}{3 x+4}$, we use the Quotient Rule given below:

If $y=\frac{u}{v}$, where $u$ and $v$ are functions of $x$, then

## Quotient Rule

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{v \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}-u \frac{\mathrm{~d} v}{\mathrm{~d} x}}{v^{2}}
$$

Quotient Rule in words

Given a quotient i.e. $y=\frac{\text { top }}{\text { bottom }}$ then the quotient rule can be expressed in words as:

Bottom $\times$ Derivative of the top - Top $\times$ Derivative of the bottom (Bottom) ${ }^{2}$

## Example 2

If $f(x)=\frac{x^{2}+7}{3 x-1}$, find $f^{\prime}(x)$.
$\frac{x^{2}+7}{3 x-1}$ is a quotient in which $\quad u=x^{2}+7 \quad$ and $\quad v=3 x-1$

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}=2 x \quad \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} v}{\mathrm{~d} x}=3 \\
f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{v \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}-u \frac{\mathrm{~d} v}{\mathrm{~d} x}}{v^{2}} \\
=\frac{(3 x-1)(2 x)-\left(x^{2}+7\right)(3)}{(3 x-1)^{2}}=\frac{6 x^{2}-2 x-3 x^{2}-21}{(3 x-1)^{2}} \\
\Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{3 x^{2}-2 x-21}{(3 x-1)^{2}}
\end{gathered}
$$

## 3. The Chain Rule

When we write $y=(3 x-4)^{3}$, we say that $y$ is a function of $x$.
If we let $u=(3 x-4)$, then we have

$$
y=u^{3} \text { and } u=3 x-4
$$

Now, $y$ is a function of $u$ and $u$ is a function of $x$.
For this reason, the function $y=(3 x-4)^{3}$ is said to be a composite function or a function of a function.

Other examples of composite functions are:
(i) $y=(1-6 x)^{4}$
(ii) $y=\sqrt{5 x+2}$
(iii) $y=\sqrt[3]{3 x^{2}+6}$

The function $y=(3 x-4)^{3}$ could be differentiated by expanding the brackets and differentiating the result. However, it can also be differentiated in a more economical way by using a method called the Chain Rule.
To differentiate the function $y=(3 x-4)^{3}$, we let $u=3 x-4$.
Then, $y=u^{3}$ and $u=3 x-4$.
The Chain Rule states that $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x} & y & =u^{3} \text { and } u=3 x-4 \\
& =3 u^{2} \cdot 3 & \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u}=3 u^{2} \text { and } \frac{\mathrm{d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}=3 \\
& =9 u^{2}=9(3 x-4)^{3} &
\end{array}
$$

If $y$ is a function of $u$, and $u$ is a function of $x$,
The Chain Rule

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}
$$

## Example 3

Find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ if (i) $y=\left(2 x^{2}-1\right)^{3} \quad$ (ii) $y=\sqrt{3 x^{2}-2}$.
(i) $y=\left(2 x^{2}-1\right)^{3}$

Let $u=2 x^{2}-1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y=u^{3}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}=4 x \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u}=3 u^{2} \\
& \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x} \\
& \quad=3 u^{2} \cdot 4 x=3\left(2 x^{2}-1\right)^{2} \cdot 4 x=12 x\left(2 x^{2}-1\right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $y=\sqrt{3 x^{2}-2}=\left(3 x^{2}-2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$

Let $u=3 x^{2}-2 \Rightarrow y=\sqrt{u}=u^{\frac{1}{2}}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}=6 x \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u}=\frac{1}{2} u^{-\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{2 u^{\frac{1}{2}}}=\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{u}}$
$\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}$

$$
=\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{u}} \cdot 6 x=\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{3 x^{2}-2}} \cdot 6 x=\frac{3 x}{\sqrt{3 x^{2}-2}}
$$

In the examples above, $u$ was substituted for the function of $x$ inside the brackets.
In practice, we will omit this step and write down the derivative of a composite function without the use of substitution.

Here are some examples:
(i) $y=(2 x+5)^{3}$
(ii) $\quad y=\left(x^{2}-3 x\right)^{4}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =3(2 x+5)^{2} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}(2 x+5) \\
& =3(2 x+5)^{2}(2) \\
& =6(2 x+5)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =4\left(x^{2}-3 x\right)^{3} \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}\left(x^{2}-3 x\right) \\
& =4\left(x^{2}-3 x\right)^{3}(2 x-3) \\
& =4(2 x-3)\left(x^{2}-3 x\right)^{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 4

Find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ if (i) $y=\left(x^{2}-3 x\right)^{4} \quad$ (ii) $y=\sqrt{x^{2}-6 x}$.
(i) $y=\left(x^{2}-3 x\right)^{4}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =4\left(x^{2}-3 x\right)^{3}(2 x-3) \quad \ldots(2 x-3) \text { is } \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}\left(x^{2}-3 x\right) \\
& =4(2 x-3)\left(x^{2}-3 x\right)^{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $y=\sqrt{x^{2}-6 x} \Rightarrow y=\left(x^{2}-6 x\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(x^{2}-6 x\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(2 x-6) \\
& =\frac{2 x-6}{2\left(x^{2}-6 x\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}}=\frac{2(x-3)}{2 \sqrt{x^{2}-6 x}}=\frac{x-3}{\sqrt{x^{2}-6 x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 5

If $y=\frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x}}$, evaluate $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ when $x=-3$.
Here we have a quotient in which $\quad u=x \quad$ and $\quad v=\sqrt{1-x}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}=1 \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{\mathrm{d} v}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{1}{2}(1-x)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(-1) \\
& =\frac{-1}{2 \sqrt{1-x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \begin{aligned}
& \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{v \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}-u \frac{\mathrm{~d} v}{\mathrm{~d} x}}{v^{2}} \\
&=\frac{\sqrt{1-x} \cdot 1-x\left(\frac{-1}{2 \sqrt{1-x}}\right)}{1-x} \\
&=\frac{\sqrt{1-x}+\frac{x}{2 \sqrt{1-x}}}{1-x} \\
&=\frac{2(1-x)+x}{2 \sqrt{1-x}(1-x)} \quad \ldots \text { multiply each term above and below by } 2 \sqrt{1-x} \\
& \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{2-x}{2 \sqrt{1-x}(1-x)} \\
& \text { When } x=-3, \quad \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{2-(-3)}{2 \sqrt{1-(-3)}(1-(-3))}=\frac{5}{16} \\
& \therefore \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{5}{16}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 7.6 Second derivatives

For any function $y=f(x)$, the first derivative is $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ or $f^{\prime}(x)$.
If we differentiate the resulting function, we get the second derivative.
The second derivative is denoted by $\frac{\mathbf{d}^{2} \boldsymbol{y}}{\mathbf{d} \boldsymbol{x}^{2}}$ or $\boldsymbol{f}^{\prime \prime}(\boldsymbol{x})$.
$\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$ is pronounced 'dee two $y$ dee $x$ squared'.
We learned earlier that for any function $y=f(x), \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ represents the slope of the tangent to the curve at any point on the curve. When dealing with the graphs of functions in book 5, we will see that $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$ gives the rate at which the slope is changing over a given interval.

## Example 1

Given that $y=x+\frac{1}{x}$, find $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y=x+\frac{1}{x} \Rightarrow & y=x+x^{-1} \\
& \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=1-x^{-2} \\
\Rightarrow & \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=0+2 x^{-3}=\frac{2}{x^{3}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

If $y=\frac{3}{x}+4 x$, find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$; hence, show that $x^{2} \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}+x \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}-y=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y=\frac{3}{x}+4 x & \Rightarrow y=3 x^{-1}+4 x \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=-3 x^{-2}+4=-\frac{3}{x^{2}}+4 \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=6 x^{-3}=\frac{6}{x^{3}}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\text { Now, } \begin{aligned}
& x^{2} \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}+x \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}-y \\
& =x^{2}\left(\frac{6}{x^{3}}\right)+x\left(-\frac{3}{x^{2}}+4\right)-\left(\frac{3}{x}+4 x\right) \\
& =\frac{6}{x}-\frac{3}{x}+4 x-\frac{3}{x}-4 x \\
& =\frac{6}{x}-\frac{3}{x}-\frac{3}{x}=\frac{6-3-3}{x}=\frac{0}{x}=0 \\
\Rightarrow & x^{2} \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}+x \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}-y=0
\end{aligned}
$$

## Exercise 7.6

1. $y=x^{3}+2 x^{2}$
2. $y=x^{4}-3 x^{2}+6$
3. $y=\frac{1}{x}$
4. $y=\frac{1}{x^{2}}+3 x^{2}$
5. $y=3 x+\frac{1}{x}+4$
6. $y=\sqrt{x}$
7. $y=\sqrt{2 x+3}$
8. $y=(3 x-2)^{3}$
9. $y=\frac{1}{x+4}$
10. Given that $y=x^{4}-x^{3}+4 x-1$, find $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$ and hence find the values of $x$ for which $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=0$.
11. If $y=3 x+\frac{4}{x}$, show that $x^{2} \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}+x \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}-y=0$.
12. Given that $f(x)=\frac{2}{x}+4 \sqrt{x}$, show that $f^{\prime \prime}(4)=-\frac{1}{16}$.
13. Given that $y=x^{4}$, show that $\frac{4 x^{4}}{3}\left(\frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}\right)-\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}\right)^{2}=0$.
14. Given that $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$, find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$.

Hence, show that $2 x\left(\frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}\right)+3 \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0$.

## Section 7.7 The derivatives of trigonometric functions -

The basic rules for differentiation apply to trigonometric functions also.
The derivatives of the three principal trigonometric functions are highlighted below:

Standard trigonometric derivatives

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}(\sin x)=\cos x \quad \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}(\cos x)=-\sin x \quad \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}(\tan x)=\sec ^{2} x
$$

The following examples illustrate the use of the Product Rule, the Quotient Rule and the Chain Rule when differentiating trigonometric functions.

## Example 1

Differentiate each of the following with respect to $x$ :
(i) $y=3 \sin x+2 \cos x$
(ii) $y=x^{2} \sin x$
(i) $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=3 \cos x+2(-\sin x)=3 \cos x-2 \sin x$
(ii) $y=x^{2} \sin x$
(Here we have a product where $u=x^{2}$ and $v=\sin x$.)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =u \frac{\mathrm{~d} v}{\mathrm{~d} x}+v \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x} \\
& =x^{2}(\cos x)+\sin x(2 x) \\
\Rightarrow \quad \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =x^{2} \cos x+2 x \sin x
\end{aligned}
$$

## Use of Chain Rule

The use of the Chain Rule is particularly important in the differentiation of trigonometric functions.

To differentiate $y=\sin 4 x$, we let $u=4 x$.

## Chain Rule

 $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}$$$
\begin{aligned}
y & =\sin u \quad \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}=4 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\cos u
\end{aligned}
$$

By the Chain Rule, $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}$

$$
=\cos u \times 4=4 \cos u=4 \cos 4 x
$$

In practice, we generally do not use the substitution method to apply the Chain Rule.
If $y=\sin 6 x \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\cos 6 x \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}(6 x)=\cos 6 x \cdot 6=6 \cos 6 x$

Here are two more examples of the use of the Chain Rule:
(i) If $y=\sin x^{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\cos x^{2} \cdot(2 x) \\
& =2 x \cos ^{2} x
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) If $y=\cos \left(3 x^{2}+x\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =-\sin \left(3 x^{2}+x\right) \cdot(6 x+1) \\
& =-(6 x+1) \sin \left(3 x^{2}+x\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

## The derivative of $\sin ^{n} x$ and $\cos ^{n} x$

To differentiate $y=\sin ^{4} x$, we let $u=\sin x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow y=u^{4} \quad \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\cos x \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u}=4 u^{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}=4 u^{3} \cdot \cos x$

$$
\begin{aligned}
&=4 \sin ^{3} x \cdot \cos x \\
& \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=4 \sin ^{3} x \cdot \cos x
\end{aligned}
$$

Again, in practice we can write down the derivative of $\cos ^{3} x$, for example, without using a substitution.

If $y=\cos ^{3} x$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =3 \cos ^{2} x \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}(\cos x) \\
& =3 \cos ^{2} x \cdot(-\sin x)=-3 \cos ^{2} x \sin x
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, if $y=\tan \left(3 x^{2}\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\sec ^{2}\left(3 x^{2}\right) \cdot 6 x \\
& =6 x \sec ^{2}\left(3 x^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Using the Chain Rule twice

Consider the function $y=\sin ^{3}(5 x+2)$.

$$
\Rightarrow y=[\sin (5 x+2)]^{3}
$$

$$
\sin ^{3} x=(\sin x)^{3}
$$

Without using any substitution we can write down the derivative of $\sin ^{3}(5 x+2)$ by
(i) finding the derivative of the power, i.e. $3 \sin ^{2}(5 x+2)$
(ii) multiplying the result by the derivative of the trigonometric function $\sin (5 x+2)$, which is $\cos (5 x+2)$.
(iii) multiplying the two previous results by the derivative of the angle ( $5 x+2$ ), i.e. 5 .

Thus, for

$$
y=\sin ^{3}(5 x+2)
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =3 \sin ^{2}(5 x+2) \cos (5 x+2) .5 \\
& =15 \sin ^{2}(5 x+2) \cos (5 x+2)
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, if $\quad y=\cos ^{4}(3 x-1)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =4 \cos ^{3}(3 x-1)[-\sin (3 x-1) \cdot 3] \\
& =-12 \cos ^{3}(3 x-1) \sin (3 x-1)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

Find the derivative of each of the following:
(i) $\cos (7 x-3)$
(ii) $\tan ^{2} 3 x$
(iii) $\sin ^{3}\left(x^{2}+2\right)$
(i) Let $y=\cos (7 x-3)$

$$
\frac{d y}{d x}=-\sin (7 x-3) \cdot 7=-7 \sin (7 x-3)
$$

(ii) Let $y=\tan ^{2} 3 x$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =2 \tan 3 x \cdot \sec ^{2} 3 x \cdot 3 \\
& =6 \tan 3 x \sec ^{2} 3 x
\end{aligned}
$$

(iii) Let $y=\sin ^{3}\left(x^{2}+2\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =3 \sin ^{2}\left(x^{2}+2\right) \cdot \cos \left(x^{2}+2\right) \cdot 2 x \\
& =6 x \sin ^{2}\left(x^{2}+2\right) \cos \left(x^{2}+2\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

If $f(x)=\frac{1+\sin x}{\cos x}$, show that $f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{1+\sin x}{\cos ^{2} x}$ and hence evaluate $f^{\prime}(\pi)$.
$\frac{1+\sin x}{\cos x}$ is of the form $\frac{u}{v}$, so we use the Quotient Rule to find $f^{\prime}(x)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f^{\prime}(x) & =\frac{v \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}-u \frac{\mathrm{~d} v}{\mathrm{~d} x}}{v^{2}} \\
& =\frac{\cos x(\cos x)-(1+\sin x)(-\sin x)}{(\cos x)^{2}} \\
& =\frac{\cos ^{2} x+\sin x+\sin ^{2} x}{\cos ^{2} x}=\frac{1+\sin x}{\cos ^{2} x} \quad \ldots\left(\sin ^{2} x+\cos ^{2} x=1\right) \\
f^{\prime}(\pi) & =\frac{1+\sin \pi}{\cos ^{2} \pi}=\frac{1+0}{(-1)^{2}}=\frac{1}{1}=1
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 7.8 Differentiation of inverse trigonometric functions

Since $\sin \frac{\pi}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$, we use the notation $\frac{\pi}{6}=\sin ^{-1} \frac{1}{2}$ to state that
" $\frac{\pi}{6}$ is an angle, the sine of which is $\frac{1}{2}$ ".
Thus, it is important to note that $\sin ^{-1} \frac{1}{2}$ is an angle.
To differentiate the function $y=\sin ^{-1} \frac{x}{a}$, we change the function to the form $\sin y=\frac{x}{a}$.

$$
\sin y=\frac{x}{a} \Rightarrow x=a \sin y, \text { where } a \text { is a constant. }
$$

We will now find $\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{~d} y}$ and then write down the reciprocal of the answer to get $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x & =a \sin y \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} x}{\mathrm{~d} y} & =a \cos y \\
& =a\left[\frac{\sqrt{a^{2}-x^{2}}}{a}\right]=\sqrt{a^{2}-x^{2}} \quad \ldots \text { see triangle } \\
\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{~d} y} & =\sqrt{a^{2}-x^{2}} \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{a^{2}-x^{2}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

This shows that if $y=\sin ^{-1} \frac{x}{a}$, then $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{a^{2}-x^{2}}}$
The standard derivatives for $f(x)=\sin ^{-1} \frac{x}{a}, f(x)=\tan ^{-1} \frac{x}{a}$ and $f(x)=\cos ^{-1} \frac{x}{a}$ are given below.

Standard derivatives of inverse functions

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(x)=\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) \Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{a^{2}-x^{2}}} \\
& f(x)=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) \Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{a}{a^{2}+x^{2}} \\
& f(x)=\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) \Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{a^{2}-x^{2}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The next worked example shows how the function $y=\sin ^{-1} \frac{5 x}{3}$ can be differentiated using the standard derivative for $\sin ^{-1} \frac{x}{a}$ and the Chain Rule.

## Example 1

If $y=\sin ^{-1} \frac{5 x}{3}$, find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
y & =\sin ^{-1} \frac{5 x}{3} & \text { Let } \quad u=\frac{5 x}{3} \\
\Rightarrow \quad y & =\sin ^{-1} u & \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^{2}}} \quad \ldots a=1 & \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{5}{3} \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x} \\
& =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^{2}}} \cdot \frac{5}{3} \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{5}{3 \cdot \sqrt{1-\frac{25 x^{2}}{9}}}=\frac{5}{3 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{9-25 x^{2}}{9}}}=\frac{5}{3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{9-25 x^{2}}}=\frac{5}{\sqrt{9-25 x^{2}}}
\end{array}
$$

## Example 2

If $y=\tan ^{-1}(2 x+1)$, find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
y & =\tan ^{-1}(2 x+1) & \text { Let } \quad u=2 x+1 & \\
\Rightarrow y & =\tan ^{-1} u & \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}=2 & \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} & =\frac{1}{1+u^{2}} \quad \ldots a=1, \text { since } 2 x+1=\frac{2 x+1}{1} & \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x} & \\
& =\frac{1}{1+u^{2}} \cdot 2=\frac{2}{1+(2 x+1)^{2}}=\frac{2}{1+4 x^{2}+4 x+1}=\frac{2}{2\left(2 x^{2}+2 x+1\right)} \\
& =\frac{1}{2 x^{2}+2 x+1} \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{1}{2 x^{2}+2 x+1}
\end{array}
$$

## Section 7.9 Differentiation of exponential functions

The word exponent is often used instead of index.
A function such as $y=2^{x}$, where the variable occurs in the index, is called an exponential function.

The diagram on the right shows the graphs of these three functions
(i) $y=2^{x}$
(ii) $y=e^{x}$
(iii) $y=4^{x}$

The function illustrated by the red curve is $\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{e}^{\boldsymbol{x}}$.
It is by far the most important exponential function.
It is generally referred to as the exponential function. $e$ is an irrational number whose value is 2.718, correct to three decimal places.

This function will be studied more closely in chapter 12.

The importance of the function $y=e^{x}$ lies in the fact that the slope at any point on the curve is always the same as the $y$-value of the function.
For example, if $x=2$, then $y=e^{2}=7.39 \ldots$
If an accurate diagram is drawn, it can be shown that the slope of the tangent at the point $x=2$ is also 7.39. This leads us to a very important derivative, namely:

For $y=e^{x}, \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=e^{x}$.
Notice that $e^{x}$ is its own derivative and, in fact, is the only basic function which is its own derivative.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-298.jpg?height=607&width=427&top_left_y=168&top_left_x=1201)

Standard derivative If $y=e^{x}$, then $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=e^{x}$.

Note: $e^{x}$ is a continuously increasing function and can be used to model the growth of a cell, the spread of an infection, or the increase in size of a population.
$e^{-x}$ is a decreasing function and can represent a rate of decay such as the rate at which a body loses heat or radioactive decay.
If $y=e^{a x}$, where $a$ is a constant, it can be shown by using the Chain Rule that $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=a e^{a x}$. If $y=e^{6 x}$, then using the Chain Rule,
$\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=e^{6 x} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}(6 x)=e^{6 x} \cdot 6=6 e^{6 x}$
Similarly, if $y=e^{x^{2}+4 x}, \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=e^{x^{2}+4 x}(2 x+4)$

$$
=(2 x+4) e^{x^{2}+4 x}
$$

## Example 1

Find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ for each of the following:
(i) $y=5 e^{x^{2}}$
(ii) $y=e^{\cos x}$
(iii) $y=\left(e^{x}+1\right)^{4}$
(i) $y=5 e^{x^{2}} \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=5 e^{x^{2}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}\left(x^{2}\right)=5 e^{x^{2}} \cdot 2 x=10 x e^{x^{2}}$
(ii) $y=e^{\cos x} \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=e^{\cos x} \cdot(-\sin x)=-\sin x\left(e^{\cos x}\right)$
(iii) $y=\left(e^{x}+1\right)^{4} \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=4\left(e^{x}+1\right)^{3} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}\left(e^{x}+1\right)$

$$
=4\left(e^{x}+1\right)^{3} \cdot e^{x}=4 e^{x}\left(e^{x}+1\right)^{3}
$$

## Example 2

If $y=e^{2 x} \cos 2 x$, find the value of $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ at $x=\frac{\pi}{8}$.

$$
y=e^{2 x} \cos 2 x
$$

Here we use the Product Rule, $y=u v \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=u \frac{\mathrm{~d} v}{\mathrm{~d} x}+v \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =e^{2 x}(-2 \sin 2 x)+\cos 2 x\left(2 e^{2 x}\right) \quad \ldots u=e^{2 x} \text { and } v=\cos 2 x \\
& =-2 \sin 2 x \cdot e^{2 x}+2 \cos 2 x \cdot e^{2 x} \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =2 e^{2 x}(-\sin 2 x+\cos 2 x) \\
\operatorname{At} x=\frac{\pi}{8} \quad \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =2 e^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\left(-\sin \frac{\pi}{4}+\cos \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \\
& =2 e^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)=2 e^{\frac{\pi}{4}}(0)=0 \\
\therefore \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =0
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 7.10 Differentiating logarithmic functions

In the previous section we found the derivative of exponential functions. A log function is the inverse function of an exponential function and will be studied in detail in chapter 12.
The equation $8=2^{3}$ can be written as $\log _{2} 8=3$, where 2 is the base number.

Logarithms to the base $e$ are called natural logarithms.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-300.jpg?height=361&width=409&top_left_y=1248&top_left_x=1219)

If $x=e^{y}$, then $y=\ln x$ i.e. if $y=e^{x}$ then $x=\log _{e} y$ which is usually written $x=\ln y$ or if $x=e^{y}$ then $y=\ln x$.

For this reason, $y=\ln x$ is the inverse of the function $y=e^{x}$.
To find the derivative of $y=\ln x$, we use the fact that if $y=\ln x$, then by definition $e^{y}=x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y & =\ln x \\
\Rightarrow \quad x & =e^{y} \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} x}{\mathrm{~d} y} & =e^{y} \quad \ldots \text { differentiate with respect to } y \\
\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{1}{e^{y}} \quad \ldots \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} \text { is the reciprocal of } \frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{~d} y} \\
\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{1}{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

When dealing with natural logarithms, the following results from chapter 12 are important:
(i) $\log _{e} 1=0 \quad \ldots$ (the $\log$ of 1 to any base is zero)
(ii) $\log _{e} e=1 \quad \ldots\left(\log _{k} k=1\right)$
(iii) $\log _{e} e^{x}=x \log _{e} e=x$

The work involved in differentiating logarithmic functions can be simplified by using the laws of logarithms which are reproduced below:
Laws of
(i) $\log _{e}(x y)=\log _{e} x+\log _{e} y$
(ii) $\log _{e}\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)=\log _{e} x-\log _{e} y$
Logarithms
(iii) $\log _{e} x^{n}=n \log _{e} x$
(iv) $\log _{a} x=\frac{\log _{e} x}{\log _{e} a}$

Note: If $y=\log _{e}(6 x)$, we use logarithmic differentiation and the Chain Rule to find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.
$y=\log _{e}(6 x) \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{1}{6 x} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}(6 x)=\frac{1}{6 x} \cdot \frac{6}{1}=\frac{1}{x}$

In general, $\quad$ If $y=\log _{e}(f(x)), \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{1}{f(x)} \cdot f^{\prime}(x)$

## Example 1

Find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ if
(i) $y=\log _{e}\left(4 x^{2}+1\right)$
(ii) $y=\log _{e}\left(\sin ^{2} x\right)$.
(i) $y=\log _{e}\left(4 x^{2}+1\right) \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{1}{4 x^{2}+1} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}\left(4 x^{2}+1\right)$

$$
=\frac{1}{4 x^{2}+1} \cdot 8 x=\frac{8 x}{4 x^{2}+1}
$$

(ii) $y=\log _{e}\left(\sin ^{2} x\right) \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{1}{\sin ^{2} x} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d}}{\mathrm{~d} x}\left(\sin ^{2} x\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
=\frac{1}{\sin ^{2} x} \cdot 2 \sin x \cos x & =\frac{2 \cos x}{\sin x} \\
& =2 \cot x
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

Given that $y=\log _{e}\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right)$, show that $\left(1-x^{2}\right) \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=2$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y & =\log _{e}\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right) \\
\Rightarrow y & =\log _{e}(1+x)-\log _{e}(1-x) \quad \ldots\left(\log _{e} \frac{a}{b}=\log _{e} a-\log _{e} b\right) \\
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{1}{1+x} \cdot(1)-\frac{1}{1-x} \cdot(-1) \\
& =\frac{1}{1+x}+\frac{1}{1-x}=\frac{1-x+1+x}{(1+x)(1-x)}=\frac{2}{1-x^{2}} \\
& \therefore\left(1-x^{2}\right) \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\left(1-x^{2}\right) \times \frac{2}{\left(1-x^{2}\right)}=2
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 8.1 Trigonometric identities

We are already familiar with the three basic trigonometric ratios, namely sine, cosine and tangent.
Three related ratios are defined as:

$$
\operatorname{cosec} A=\frac{1}{\sin A} \quad \sec A=\frac{1}{\cos A} \quad \cot A=\frac{1}{\tan A}
$$

In the given triangle

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}=\frac{y}{r} \div \frac{x}{r}=\frac{y}{r} \times \frac{r}{x}=\frac{y}{x}=\tan \theta \\
\Rightarrow \quad & \tan \theta=\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}
\end{aligned}
$$

This relationship between trigonometric ratios is called an identity because it is true for all values of $\theta$ in a given domain.
The mandatory proofs of key standard trigonometric formulae are boxed separately and are flagged by a Mandatory Proof box. Other derivations are shown in the text and examples.

## Mandatory Proof

To prove that $\cos ^{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{\theta}+\boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }}^{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{\theta}=\mathbf{1}$
We have already established that any point on the unit circle is defined by the coordinates ( $\boldsymbol{\operatorname { c o s }} \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }} \boldsymbol{\theta}$ ).
In the given diagram $|\mathrm{OP}|=1$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \sqrt{(\cos \theta-0)^{2}+(\sin \theta-0)^{2}}=1 \\
& \Rightarrow \sqrt{\cos ^{2} \theta+\sin ^{2} \theta}=1 \\
& \Rightarrow \cos ^{2} \boldsymbol{\theta}+\sin ^{2} \boldsymbol{\theta}=\mathbf{1} \ldots \text { (squaring both sides) }
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-308.jpg?height=416&width=496&top_left_y=1786&top_left_x=1115)

If each term in the equation $\sin ^{2} \theta+\cos ^{2} \theta=1$ is divided by $\cos ^{2} \theta$, we get,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\sin ^{2} \theta}{\cos ^{2} \theta}+\frac{\cos ^{2} \theta}{\cos ^{2} \theta}=\frac{1}{\cos ^{2} \theta} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \tan ^{2} \theta+1=\sec ^{2} \theta \\
& \Rightarrow \quad 1+\tan ^{2} \theta=\sec ^{2} \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

The identities established above should be memorised as they are used very frequently to prove more complex identities. These identities are highlighted in the box below.

1. $\operatorname{cosec} \theta=\frac{1}{\sin \theta}$
2. $\sec \theta=\frac{1}{\cos \theta}$
3. $\tan \theta=\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$
4. $\cot \theta=\frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}$
5. $\sin ^{2} \theta+\cos ^{2} \theta=1$
6. $1+\tan ^{2} \theta=\sec ^{2} \theta$

It follows from $\mathbf{5}$ that $\sin ^{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{\theta}=\mathbf{1}-\cos ^{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{\theta}$ and $\cos ^{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{\theta}=\mathbf{1}-\sin ^{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{\theta}$.
The general method of proving an identity is to choose one side that allows development and show, by using known identities, that it can be simplified into the form of the other side.

This is illustrated in the following examples.

## Example 1

Prove these identities:
(i) $\sec A-\tan A \sin A=\cos A$
(ii) $\tan \theta \sqrt{1-\sin ^{2} \theta}=\sin \theta$.
(i) Here we change all ratios to sine and cosine ratios.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sec A-\tan A \sin A & =\frac{1}{\cos A}-\frac{\sin A}{\cos A} \cdot \sin A \\
& =\frac{1}{\cos A}-\frac{\sin ^{2} A}{\cos A} \\
& =\frac{1-\sin ^{2} A}{\cos A}=\frac{\cos ^{2} A}{\cos A}=\cos A=\text { Right-hand side (RHS) }
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $\tan \theta \sqrt{1-\sin ^{2} \theta}=\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \cdot \sqrt{\cos ^{2} \theta} \ldots 1-\sin ^{2} \theta=\cos ^{2} \theta$

$$
=\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \cdot \frac{\cos \theta}{1}=\sin \theta=\mathrm{RHS}
$$

## Example 2

Prove that $\frac{\tan \theta+\sin \theta}{\sec \theta+1}=\sin \theta$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\tan \theta+\sin \theta}{\sec \theta+1} & =\frac{\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}+\frac{\sin \theta}{1}}{\frac{1}{\cos \theta}+1} \\
& =\frac{\sin \theta+\sin \theta \cos \theta}{1+\cos \theta} \ldots(\text { multiply each term above and below by } \cos \theta) \\
& =\frac{\sin \theta(1+\cos \theta)}{(1+\cos \theta)}=\sin \theta=\text { RHS }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Identities involving the Sine Rule and Cosine Rule

The Sine Rule states that $\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}$
This can be also written as $\sin A=\frac{a \sin B}{b}$
The Cosine Rule states that $a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b c \cos A$.
This can also be written as $\cos A=\frac{b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}}{2 b c}$.
Identities involving the sides $a, b$ and $c$ of a triangle generally require the use of the Sine or Cosine Rules to prove them.

## Example 3

Prove that in any triangle, $c \cos B-b \cos C=\frac{c^{2}-b^{2}}{a}$
Using the Cosine Rule, we have

$$
\cos B=\frac{c^{2}+a^{2}-b^{2}}{2 a c} \text { and } \cos C=\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}{2 a b}
$$

Thus $c \cos B-b \cos C=\frac{c\left(c^{2}+a^{2}-b^{2}\right)}{2 a c}-\frac{b\left(a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}\right)}{2 a b}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{c^{2}+a^{2}-b^{2}}{2 a}-\frac{\left(a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}\right)}{2 a} \\
& \begin{aligned}
=\frac{c^{2}+a^{2}-b^{2}-a^{2}-b^{2}+c^{2}}{2 a} & =\frac{2 c^{2}-2 b^{2}}{2 a} \\
& =\frac{c^{2}-b^{2}}{a}=\text { RHS }
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Exercise 8.1

Prove the following identities:

1. $\cos A \tan A=\sin A$
2. $\sin \theta \sec \theta=\tan \theta$
3. $\sin \theta \tan \theta+\cos \theta=\sec \theta$
4. $\frac{\sin \theta}{\sqrt{1-\sin ^{2} \theta}}=\tan \theta$
5. $\sec A-\sin A \tan A=\cos A$
6. $1-\tan ^{2} \theta \cos ^{2} \theta=\cos ^{2} \theta$
7. $\frac{(1+\cos \theta)(1-\cos \theta)}{\cos ^{2} \theta}=\tan ^{2} \theta$
8. $\sec ^{2} A-\tan ^{2} A=1$
9. $\frac{\sqrt{1-\cos ^{2} \theta}}{\tan \theta}=\cos \theta$
10. $\left(1+\tan ^{2} \theta\right) \cos ^{2} \theta=1$
11. $(\cos \theta+\sin \theta)^{2}+(\cos \theta-\sin \theta)^{2}=2$.
12. $\left(1+\tan ^{2} A\right)\left(1-\sin ^{2} A\right)=1$
13. $(\sin \theta+\cos \theta)^{2}-2 \sin \theta \cos \theta=1$
14. $\frac{1-\cos ^{2} A}{\sin A \cos A}=\tan A$
15. $\frac{1}{1-\sin A}+\frac{1}{1+\sin A}=2 \sec ^{2} A$
16. $\left(1-\sin ^{2} A\right) \tan ^{2} A+\cos ^{2} A=1$
17. $\operatorname{cosec}^{2} \theta\left(\tan ^{2} \theta-\sin ^{2} \theta\right)=\tan ^{2} \theta$
18. $(1-\sin A)(\sec A+\tan A)=\cos A$

Use the Sine Rule or Cosine Rule to prove the following identities:
19. $b \cos C+c \cos B=a$
20. $b c \cos A+c a \cos B=c^{2}$
21. $c=b \cos A+a \cos B$
22. $a \cos B-b \cos A=\frac{a^{2}-b^{2}}{c}$
23. $a b \cos C-a c \cos B=b^{2}-c^{2}$
24. $c \cos B-b \cos C=\frac{c^{2}-b^{2}}{a}$
25. Use the Sine Rule to prove that $\frac{\sin A-\sin B}{\sin B}=\frac{a-b}{b}$.
26. Prove that $\frac{\cos A}{a}+\frac{\cos B}{b}+\frac{\cos C}{c}=\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}}{2 a b c}$.

## Section 8.2 Compound angles

If $A$ and $B$ are two given angles, then $(A+B)$ and $(A-B)$ are called compound angles.
In this section we will establish formulae for $\cos (A \pm B), \sin (A \pm B)$ and $\tan (A \pm B)$ by expressing them in terms of $\sin A, \cos A$ and $\tan A$.
We will first establish the formula for $\cos (A-B)$ and then use already established identities to prove the other formulae.

## Mandatory Proof

## To prove that $\cos (\boldsymbol{A}-\boldsymbol{B})=\cos \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\operatorname { c o s }} \boldsymbol{B}-\boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }} \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }} \boldsymbol{B}$

Let the radii $[\mathrm{OP}]$ and $[\mathrm{OQ}]$ make angles A and B with the positive $x$-axis.

$$
|\angle \mathrm{POQ}|=\mathrm{A}-\mathrm{B}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-311.jpg?height=364&width=666&top_left_y=1857&top_left_x=928)

We now find $|\mathrm{PQ}|$ using two different methods:

1. the standard formula for the distance between two points
2. the cosine rule.
3. Using the formula $\sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}}$, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
|\mathrm{PQ}|^{2} & =(\cos A-\cos B)^{2}+(\sin A-\sin B)^{2} \\
& =\cos ^{2} A-2 \cos A \cos B+\cos ^{2} B+\sin ^{2} A-2 \sin A \sin B+\sin ^{2} B \\
& =\cos ^{2} A+\sin ^{2} A-2 \cos A \cos B+\sin ^{2} B-2 \sin A \sin B
\end{aligned}
$$

But $\cos ^{2} A+\sin ^{2} A=1$ and $\cos ^{2} B+\sin ^{2} B=1$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad|\mathrm{PQ}|^{2} & =1-2 \cos A \cos B+1-2 \sin A \sin B \\
& =2-2(\cos A \cos B+\sin A \sin B) \ldots \text { (1) }
\end{aligned}
$$

2. Now using the cosine rule to find $|\mathrm{PQ}|$, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
|\mathrm{PQ}|^{2} & =|\mathrm{OP}|^{2}+|\mathrm{OQ}|^{2}-2|\mathrm{OP}||\mathrm{OQ}| \cos (A-B) \\
& =1+1-2(1)(1) \cos (A-B) \ldots|\mathrm{OP}|=|\mathrm{OQ}|=1=\text { radius } \\
& =2-2 \cos (A-B) \ldots \text { (2) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Equating the two values for $|\mathrm{PQ}|^{2}$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2-2(\cos A \cos B+\sin A \sin B)=2-2 \cos (A-B) \\
& \Rightarrow \quad-(\cos A \cos B+\sin A \sin B)=-\cos (A-B) \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \cos (A-B)=\cos A \cos B+\sin A \sin B \ldots \ldots \text { (i) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Having established the formula for $\cos (A-B)$, we can derive the other formulae using the important identities shown on the right.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \cos (-B)=\cos B \\
& \sin (-B)=-\sin B \\
& \sin \left(90^{\circ}-A\right)=\cos A \\
& \cos \left(90^{\circ}-A\right)=\sin A
\end{aligned}
$$

## Mandatory Proof

To prove that $\cos (\boldsymbol{A}+\boldsymbol{B})=\cos \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\operatorname { c o s }} \boldsymbol{B}-\boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }} \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }} \boldsymbol{B}$
To derive the formula for $\cos (A+B)$, we replace $B$ with ( $-B$ ) in formula (i) on the previous page:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos (A-B) & =\cos A \cos B+\sin A \sin B \\
\Rightarrow \quad \cos [A-(-B)] & =\cos A \cos (-B)+\sin A \sin (-B) \\
& =\cos A \cos B+\sin A(-\sin B) \\
\Rightarrow \quad \cos (A+B)=\cos A \cos B-\sin A \sin B \ldots \ldots \text { (ii) } &
\end{aligned}
$$

To prove that $\cos (2 A)=\cos ^{2} \boldsymbol{A}-\sin ^{2} \boldsymbol{A}$
Replace $B$ with $A$ in $\cos (A+B)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \cos (A+A)=\cos A \cos A-\sin A \sin A \\
& \Rightarrow \cos (2 A)=\cos ^{2} A-\sin ^{2} A
\end{aligned}
$$

To prove that $\sin (\boldsymbol{A}+\boldsymbol{B})=\sin \boldsymbol{A} \cos \boldsymbol{B}+\cos \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }} \boldsymbol{B}$
$\cos (A-B)=\cos A \cos B+\sin A \sin B \ldots$ from (i)
To derive the formula for $\sin (A+B)$, we replace $A$ with ( $90^{\circ}-A$ ).

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad \cos \left[\left(90^{\circ}-A\right)-B\right]=\cos \left(90^{\circ}-A\right) \cos B+\sin \left(90^{\circ}-A\right) \sin B \\
&=\sin A \cos B+\cos A \sin B \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \cos \left[90^{\circ}-(A+B)\right]=\sin A \cos B+\cos A \sin B \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \sin (A+B)=\sin A \cos B+\cos A \sin B \ldots \ldots \text { (iii) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting ( $-B$ ) for $B$ in formula (iii), we get

$$
\begin{array}{rlr} 
& \sin (A-B)=\sin A \cos (-B)+\cos A \sin (-B) & \sin (-B)=-\sin B \\
\Rightarrow & \sin (A-B)=\sin A \cos B-\cos A \sin B \ldots \ldots \text { (iv) } &
\end{array}
$$

Expressions for $\tan (A+B)$ and $\tan (A-B)$ can be derived from formulae (i) to (iv) established above:

To prove that $\boldsymbol{\operatorname { t a n }}(\boldsymbol{A}+\boldsymbol{B})=\frac{\boldsymbol{\operatorname { t a n }} \boldsymbol{A}+\boldsymbol{\operatorname { t a n }} \boldsymbol{B}}{\mathbf{1}-\boldsymbol{\operatorname { t a n }} \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\operatorname { t a n }} \boldsymbol{B}}$

## Mandatory Proof

$$
\tan (A+B)=\frac{\sin (A+B)}{\cos (A+B)}=\frac{\sin A \cos B+\cos A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B-\sin A \sin B}
$$

We now divide each term in the numerator and denominator by $\cos A \cos B$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tan (A+B) & =\frac{\frac{\sin A}{\cos A}+\frac{\sin B}{\cos B}}{1-\frac{\sin A}{\cos A} \cdot \frac{\sin B}{\cos B}} \\
\Rightarrow \tan (A+B) & =\frac{\tan A+\tan B}{1-\tan A \tan B} \ldots \ldots(\mathbf{v})
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting ( $-B$ ) for $B$ in formula ( $\mathbf{v}$ ) we get:

$$
\tan (A-B)=\frac{\tan A-\tan B}{1+\tan A \tan B} \ldots \ldots \text { (vi) } \quad \tan (-B)=-\tan B
$$

Compound angle formulae

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin (A+B) & =\sin A \cos B+\cos A \sin B \\
\sin (A-B) & =\sin A \cos B-\cos A \sin B \\
\cos (A+B) & =\cos A \cos B-\sin A \sin B \\
\cos (A-B) & =\cos A \cos B+\sin A \sin B \\
\tan (A+B) & =\frac{\tan A+\tan B}{1-\tan A \tan B} ; \tan (A-B)=\frac{\tan A-\tan B}{1+\tan A \tan B}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: The exact values of the sine, cosine and tangent of the angles $30^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}$ and $60^{\circ}$ are given on page 13 of Formulae and Tables. You may also use the triangles shown on the right to find the exact trigonometric ratios of $30^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}$ and $60^{\circ}$.

## Example 1

Express in surd form
(i) $\sin 15^{\circ}$
(ii) $\tan 105^{\circ}$
(i) $\sin 15^{\circ}=\sin \left(60^{\circ}-45^{\circ}\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\sin 60^{\circ} \cos 45^{\circ}-\cos 60^{\circ} \sin 45^{\circ} \\
& =\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
& =\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2 \sqrt{2}}-\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}} \\
& =\frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{2 \sqrt{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin 60^{\circ} & =\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
\cos 60^{\circ} & =\frac{1}{2} \\
\sin 45^{\circ} & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\cos 45^{\circ} & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $\tan 105^{\circ}=\tan \left(60^{\circ}+45^{\circ}\right)$

$$
\begin{array}{l|l}
=\frac{\tan 60^{\circ}+\tan 45^{\circ}}{1-\tan 60^{\circ} \tan 45^{\circ}} & \begin{array}{l}
\tan 60^{\circ}=\sqrt{3} \\
\tan 45^{\circ}=1
\end{array} \\
=\frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{1-\sqrt{3}}=\frac{1+\sqrt{3}}{1-\sqrt{3}} & \\
=\frac{1+\sqrt{3}}{1-\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{1+\sqrt{3}}{1+\sqrt{3}}=\frac{1+2 \sqrt{3}+3}{1-3}=\frac{4+2 \sqrt{3}}{-2} \ldots & \begin{array}{l}
\text { here we rationalised } \\
\text { the denominator. }
\end{array} \\
& =-2-\sqrt{3}
\end{array}
$$

## Example 2

If $\tan A=\frac{1}{4}$ and $\tan B=\frac{3}{5}$, find the value of $(A+B)$ without using a calculator.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tan (A+B) & =\frac{\tan A+\tan B}{1-\tan A \tan B} \\
& =\frac{\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{5}}{1-\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{5}} \\
& =\frac{5+12}{20-3} \ldots \text { multiply each term above and below by } 20 \\
\Rightarrow \tan (A+B) & =\frac{17}{17}=1 \Rightarrow(A+B)=\tan ^{-1} 1 \\
& =45^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

Prove that $\frac{\sin (A+B)}{\cos A \cos B}=\tan A+\tan B$.

$$
\frac{\sin (A+B)}{\cos A \cos B}=\frac{\sin A \cos B+\cos A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B}
$$

Divide each term in the numerator and denominator by $\cos A \cos B$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad \frac{\sin (A+B)}{\cos A \cos B} & =\frac{\frac{\sin A \cos B}{\cos A \cos B}+\frac{\cos A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B}}{\frac{\cos A \cos B}{\cos A \cos B}} \\
& =\frac{\frac{\sin A}{\cos A}+\frac{\sin B}{\cos B}}{1}=\tan A+\tan B
\end{aligned}

## Section 8.3 Double-angle formulae

The compound angle formulae in the previous section deal with any two angles $A$ and $B$.
If we replace $B$ with $A$ we get very useful formulae for $\sin 2 A, \cos 2 A$ and $\tan 2 A$.

$$
\sin (A+B)=\sin A \cos B+\cos A \sin B
$$

Replacing $B$ with $A$ we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sin 2 A=\sin (A+A)=\sin A \cos A+\cos A \sin A=2 \sin A \cos A \\
& \cos 2 A=\cos (A+A)=\cos A \cos A-\sin A \sin A=\cos ^{2} A-\sin ^{2} A \\
& \tan 2 A=\tan (A+A)=\frac{\tan A+\tan A}{1-\tan A \tan A}=\frac{2 \tan A}{1-\tan ^{2} A}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the identity $\sin ^{2} A+\cos ^{2} A=1$, we get two further identities for $\cos 2 A$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos 2 A & =\cos ^{2} A-\sin ^{2} A \\
& =\left(1-\sin ^{2} A\right)-\sin ^{2} A \\
& =1-2 \sin ^{2} A
\end{aligned}
$$

or

$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos 2 A & =\cos ^{2} A-\sin ^{2} A \\
& =\cos ^{2} A-\left(1-\cos ^{2} A\right) \\
& =\cos ^{2} A-1+\cos ^{2} A \\
& =2 \cos ^{2} A-1
\end{aligned}
$$

## Double angle formulae

$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos 2 A & =\cos ^{2} A-\sin ^{2} A \\
& =2 \cos ^{2} A-1 \\
& =1-2 \sin ^{2} A
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sin 2 A=2 \sin A \cos A \\
& \tan 2 A=\frac{2 \tan A}{1-\tan ^{2} A}
\end{aligned}
$$

By rearranging the formulae for $\cos 2 A$, we can express $\cos ^{2} A$ and $\sin ^{2} A$ in terms of $\cos 2 A$ as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{rlrlrl} 
& \cos 2 A & =2 \cos ^{2} A-1 & \text { or } & & \cos 2 A \\
\Rightarrow & 2 \cos ^{2} A & =1+\cos 2 A & & =2 \sin ^{2} A \\
\Rightarrow & \cos ^{2} A & =\frac{1}{2}(1+\cos 2 A) & & 2 \sin ^{2} A & =1-\cos 2 A \\
& & & \Rightarrow & \sin ^{2} A=\frac{1}{2}(1-\cos 2 A)
\end{array}
$$

## Example 1

Express $\sin 3 A$ in terms of $\sin A$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin 3 A & =\sin (2 A+A) \\
& =\sin 2 A \cos A+\cos 2 A \sin A \\
& =2 \sin A \cos A \cos A+\left(1-2 \sin ^{2} A\right)(\sin A) \\
& =2 \sin A\left(\cos ^{2} A\right)+\sin A-2 \sin ^{3} A \\
& =2 \sin A\left(1-\sin ^{2} A\right)+\sin A-2 \sin ^{3} A \\
& =2 \sin A-2 \sin ^{3} A+\sin A-2 \sin ^{3} A \\
\Rightarrow \quad \sin 3 A & =3 \sin A-4 \sin ^{3} A
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

Given that $\theta$ is acute and that $\tan \theta=\frac{1}{2}$, evaluate
(i) $\sin 2 \theta$
(ii) $\cos 2 \theta$.

When $\tan \theta=\frac{1}{2}$, from the right-angled triangle shown we have:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-317.jpg?height=225&width=374&top_left_y=1854&top_left_x=1178)

$$
x^{2}=2^{2}+1^{2} \Rightarrow x^{2}=5 \Rightarrow x=\sqrt{5}
$$

$\Rightarrow \quad \sin \theta=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$ and $\cos \theta=\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}$
(i) $\sin 2 \theta=2 \sin \theta \cos \theta$
(ii) $\cos 2 \theta=\cos ^{2} \theta-\sin ^{2} \theta$
$=2 \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \times \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}=\frac{4}{5}$
$=\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right)^{2}=\frac{4}{5}-\frac{1}{5}=\frac{3}{5}$

The proofs of identities involving $\cos 2 A$ often depend on selecting the appropriate formula for $\cos 2 A$. The choice is generally between $\left(2 \cos ^{2} A-1\right)$ and $\left(1-2 \sin ^{2} A\right)$.

If we are given $1+\cos 2 A$, then to eliminate the 1 we select $\left(2 \cos ^{2} A-1\right)$ for $\cos 2 A$.
Thus $1+\cos 2 A$ becomes $1+2 \cos ^{2} A-1=2 \cos ^{2} A$.

## Example 3

Show that
(i) $\frac{\sin 2 A}{1+\cos 2 A}=\tan A$
(ii) $\cos ^{4} \theta-\sin ^{4} \theta=\cos 2 \theta$.
(i) $\frac{\sin 2 A}{1+\cos 2 A}=\frac{2 \sin A \cos A}{1+2 \cos ^{2} A-1}$

$$
=\frac{2 \sin A \cos A}{2 \cos ^{2} A}=\frac{\sin A}{\cos A}=\tan A
$$

(ii) $\cos ^{4} \theta-\sin ^{4} \theta=\left(\cos ^{2} \theta+\sin ^{2} \theta\right)\left(\cos ^{2} \theta-\sin ^{2} \theta\right) \quad x^{4}-y^{4}=\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =(1)(\cos 2 \theta) \\
& =\cos 2 \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

## Expressing $\sin 2 A, \cos 2 A$ and $\tan 2 A$ in terms of $\tan A$

When proving identities it is often useful to express $\sin 2 A, \cos 2 A$ and $\tan 2 A$ in terms of $\tan A$.
We have already proved that $\tan 2 A=\frac{2 \tan A}{1-\tan ^{2} A}$.
On page 14 of Formulae and Tables, the following formulae are given:
(i) $\sin 2 A=\frac{2 \tan A}{1+\tan ^{2} A}$
(ii) $\cos 2 A=\frac{1-\tan ^{2} A}{1+\tan ^{2} A}$
$\sin 2 A=\frac{2 \tan A}{1+\tan ^{2} A}$
$\cos 2 A=\frac{1-\tan ^{2} A}{1+\tan ^{2} A}$
$\tan 2 A=\frac{2 \tan A}{1-\tan ^{2} A}$

## Example 4

If $\cos 2 \theta=\frac{7}{25}$, find the values of $\sin \theta$ for $0^{\circ} \leqslant \theta \leqslant 360^{\circ}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos 2 \theta & =1-2 \sin ^{2} \theta \\
\Rightarrow \quad 1-2 \sin ^{2} \theta & =\frac{7}{25} \Rightarrow 2 \sin ^{2} \theta=\frac{18}{25} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \sin ^{2} \theta=\frac{9}{25} \Rightarrow \sin \theta= \pm \frac{3}{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 5

If $\sin 2 A=\frac{3}{5}$, find the two values of $\tan A$ for $0^{\circ}<A<90^{\circ}$.
Here we express $\sin 2 A$ in terms of $\tan A$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin 2 A=\frac{2 \tan A}{1+\tan ^{2} A} & \\
\Rightarrow \quad \frac{2 \tan A}{1+\tan ^{2} A}=\frac{3}{5} & \Rightarrow \quad 3+3 \tan ^{2} A=10 \tan A \\
& \Rightarrow \quad 3 \tan ^{2} A-10 \tan A+3=0 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad(3 \tan A-1)(\tan A-3)=0 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad 3 \tan A=1 \quad \text { or } \quad \tan A=3 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \tan A=\frac{1}{3} \quad \text { or } \quad \tan A=3
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: Since $\sin 2 A=2 \sin A \cos A$, it follows that
(i) $\sin 4 A=2 \sin 2 A \cos 2 A$
(ii) $\sin 6 A=2 \sin 3 A \cos 3 A$
(iii) $\sin A=2 \sin \frac{A}{2} \cos \frac{A}{2}$

Similarly, since $\cos 2 A=2 \cos ^{2} A-1$
(iv) $\cos 4 A=2 \cos ^{2} 2 A-1$
(v) $\cos A=2 \cos ^{2} \frac{A}{2}-1$

## Section 8.4 Sum, difference and product formulae

$\qquad$
Page 15 of Formulae and Tables contains important formulae for changing sums or differences into products. These formula are given, without proof, below.

## Changing products to sums or differences

```
$2 \sin A \cos B=\sin (A+B)+\sin (A-B)$
$2 \cos A \sin B=\sin (A+B)-\sin (A-B)$
$2 \cos A \cos B=\cos (A+B)+\cos (A-B)$
$-2 \sin A \sin B=\cos (A+B)-\cos (A-B)$
```


## Changing sums and differences to products

```
$\sin A+\sin B=2 \sin \frac{A+B}{2} \cos \frac{A-B}{2}$
$\sin A-\sin B=2 \cos \frac{A+B}{2} \sin \frac{A-B}{2}$
$\cos A+\cos B=2 \cos \frac{A+B}{2} \cos \frac{A-B}{2}$
$\cos A-\cos B=-2 \sin \frac{A+B}{2} \sin \frac{A-B}{2}$
```

Note: When changing a sum or a difference to a product, it is advisable to have the larger angle first.
Thus $\sin 3 x+\sin 5 x$ should be changed to $\sin 5 x+\sin 3 x$.
Similarly, if we are given the product $2 \sin 2 x \cos 3 x$, we should change it to $2 \cos 3 x \sin 2 x$.

## Example 1

Express as a sum or difference:
(i) $2 \cos 3 x \sin x$
(ii) $\cos \theta \cos 5 \theta$
(i) $2 \cos 3 x \sin x=\sin (3 x+x)-\sin (3 x-x)$

$$
=\sin 4 x-\sin 2 x
$$

(ii) $\cos \theta \cos 5 \theta=\cos 5 \theta \cos \theta$

Always put the bigger angle first.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{2}[2 \cos 5 \theta \cos \theta] \\
& =\frac{1}{2}[\cos (5 \theta+\theta)+\cos (5 \theta-\theta)] \\
& =\frac{1}{2}[\cos 6 \theta+\cos 4 \theta]
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

Express as a product
(i) $\cos 5 A+\cos 3 A$
(ii) $\sin 3 A-\sin A$
(i) $\cos 5 A+\cos 3 A=2 \cos \left(\frac{5 A+3 A}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{5 A-3 A}{2}\right)$

$$
=2 \cos 4 A \cos A
$$

(ii) $\sin 3 A-\sin A=2 \cos \left(\frac{3 A+A}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{3 A-A}{2}\right)$

$$
=2 \cos 2 A \sin A
$$

## Example 3

Show that $\frac{\sin 3 A-\sin 2 A+\sin A}{\cos 3 A+\cos A-\cos 2 A}=\tan 2 A$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\sin 3 A-\sin 2 A+\sin A}{\cos 3 A+\cos A-\cos 2 A} & =\frac{(\sin 3 A+\sin A)-\sin 2 A}{(\cos 3 A+\cos A)-\cos 2 A} \\
& =\frac{2 \sin 2 A \cos A-\sin 2 A}{2 \cos 2 A \cos A-\cos 2 A} \\
& =\frac{\sin 2 A(2 \cos A-1)}{\cos 2 A(2 \cos A-1)}=\frac{\sin 2 A}{\cos 2 A}=\tan 2 A
\end{aligned}
$$

$$

## Section 8.5 Inverse trigonometric functions

In the given triangle $\sin x=\frac{3}{5}$.
We could also say that ' $x$ is the angle whose sine is $\frac{3}{5}$, This is written as $\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)=x$. $\sin ^{-1}$ is pronounced 'arc sin'.
Again if (i) $\cos x=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \Rightarrow x=\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)=30^{\circ}$
(ii) $\tan x=1 \Rightarrow x=\tan ^{-1}(1)=45^{\circ}$.

It should be clear from these two examples that $\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$ and $\tan ^{-1}(1)$ are angles and that $\cos 30^{\circ}$ and $\tan 45^{\circ}$ are ratios.

## Example 1

Write down the value of each of the following angles in the range $0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$.
(i) $\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$
(ii) $\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$
(iii) $\tan ^{-1}(\sqrt{3})$
(iv) $\cos ^{-1}(0.8)$.
(i) $\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=30^{\circ}$
(ii) $\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)=45^{\circ}$
(iii) $\tan ^{-1}(\sqrt{3})=60^{\circ}$
(iv) $\cos ^{-1}(0.8)=36.9^{\circ}$ (by calculator)

## Example 2

(i) Express $\cos \left(\sin ^{-1} x\right)$ in terms of $x . \quad$ (ii) Evaluate $\sin \left(2 \tan ^{-1} \frac{4}{3}\right)$.
(i) $\sin ^{-1} x$ is the angle whose sine is $x$, as shown.

The third side is $\sqrt{1-x^{2}}$.

$$
\cos \left(\sin ^{-1} x\right)=\frac{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{1}=\sqrt{1-x^{2}}
$$

(ii) $2 \tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)$ is a double angle.

Let $\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)=A$.
$A$ is shown in the given triangle.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin \left(2 \tan ^{-1} \frac{4}{3}\right) & =\sin 2 A \\
& =2 \sin A \cos A \\
& =2\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)=\frac{24}{25}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Exercise 8.5

1. Write down the value of each of these angles in the range $-90^{\circ}$ to $180^{\circ}$, without using a calculator:

(iii) $\tan ^{-1}(1)$
(iv) $\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$
(v) $\sin ^{-1}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$
(vi) $\tan ^{-1}(-1)$
(vii) $\cos ^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)$
(viii) $\tan ^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)$
2. In each of the following, draw a triangle to show that
(i) $\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)$

(iii) $\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{5}{13}\right)=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{5}{12}\right)$
(iv) $\tan ^{-1}(x)=\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}}\right)$.
3. Simplify each of the following, expressing your answers in terms of $x$ :
(i) $\sin \left(\sin ^{-1} x\right)$
(ii) $\cos \left(\sin ^{-1} x\right)$
(iii) $\sin \left(\tan ^{-1} x\right)$.
4. Evaluate each of the following:

(ii) $\sin \left[\sin ^{-1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}+\sin ^{-1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}\right]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.
7. Evaluate $\tan \left(\sin ^{-1} \frac{3}{5}+\sin ^{-1} \frac{5}{13}\right)$.
8. Prove that $\sin \left(2 \tan ^{-1} \frac{3}{4}\right)=\sin \left(\cos ^{-1} \frac{7}{25}\right)$.

## Section 9.1 Sequences

A number sequence is a set of numbers written down in a definite order.
In most cases all the terms of the sequence are connected by a rule.
Examine the following sequences and state in words the rule that connects one term to the next. Hence find the next two terms of each sequence.
(i) $1,3,5,7, \ldots$
(vii) $1,4,9,16, \ldots$
(ii) $2,5,8,11, \ldots$
(viii) $1,2,6,24,120, \ldots$
(iii) $\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{12}, \frac{1}{24}, \ldots$
(ix) $1, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{9}, \frac{4}{27}, \ldots$
(iv) $1,2,4,8, \ldots$
(x) $4,2,0,-2, \ldots$
(v) $1^{3}, 2^{3}, 3^{3}, 4^{3}, \ldots$
(xi) $1,-1,1,-1, \ldots$
(vi) $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \ldots$
(xii) $1,-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4},-\frac{1}{8}, \ldots$

The most basic number sequence is the set of natural numbers, $\mathrm{N}=\{1,2,3,4, \ldots n\}$; all other sequences can be compared to it.

| Consider the natural numbers | 1, | 2, | 3, | 4, | 5, | $\ldots .$. |
| :--- | ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| and compare them with the sequence | $\rightarrow$ | 1, | 3, | 7, | 9, | $\ldots .$. |
|  | $T_{1}$, | $T_{2}$, | $T_{3}$, | $T_{4}$, | $T_{5}, \ldots .$. | $T_{n}$ |

The first term is $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{1}}$; the second term is $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{2}}$.
$\boldsymbol{T}_{\boldsymbol{n}}$ is called the $\boldsymbol{n}$ th term and it gives us the rule needed to find any term of the sequence.

$$
T_{n}=2 n-1
$$

$\left.\begin{array}{lll}\text { Let } & n=1, & T_{1}=2(1)-1=1 \\ \text { Let } & n=2, & T_{2}=2(2)-1=3 \\ \text { Let } & n=3, & T_{3}=2(3)-1=5 \\ \text { Let } & n=4, & T_{4}=2(4)-1=7 \text { etc. }\end{array}\right\} \begin{aligned} & \text { Hence the rule } T_{n}=2 n-1 \text { produces } \\ & \text { the sequence } 1,3,5,7, \ldots\end{aligned}$
Sequences are often derived from patterns created by different processes. In biology the arrangement of leaves on a stem can be described by the 'Fibonacci sequence' $0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13, \ldots$

Sequences are used in computational software. In physics they occur in the study of waves; sequence patterns control robot movements and are used extensively in digital technology.

Consider the following patterns and describe how to add two more elements to each pattern.

## Example 1

Write down the first four terms of each of the following sequences:
(i) $T_{n}=n^{2}+n$
(ii) $T_{n}=2^{n}-3 n$
(i) $T_{n}=n^{2}+n$
(ii) $T_{n}=2^{n}-3 n$

Let $n=1, \quad T_{1}=1^{2}+1=2$
Let $n=1, \quad T_{1}=2^{1}-3(1)=-1$
$n=2, \quad T_{2}=2^{2}+2=6$
$n=3, \quad T_{3}=3^{2}+3=12$
$n=2, \quad T_{2}=2^{2}-3(2)=-2$
$n=3, \quad T_{3}=2^{3}-3(3)=-1$
$n=4, \quad T_{4}=4^{2}+4=20$
The sequence is $2,6,12,20$.
$n=4, \quad T_{4}=2^{4}-3(4)=4$
The sequence is $-1,-2,-1,4$.

(ii) $6,10,14,18,22$ is the sequence for the blue tiles
(iii) $6,12,20,30,42$ is the sequence for the total number of tiles
(iv) $0,2,6,12,20$ is the sequence for the white tiles.
(v) (ii) We notice that $\stackrel{+4+4+4}{6,10,14,18,22}, \ldots$ each term increases by 4 . $\left.\begin{array}{l}\Rightarrow \text { the next three terms are } \quad 22+4=26 \\ 26+4=30 \\ 30+4=34\end{array}\right\} 26,30,34$
(iii) $\overbrace{6,12,20,30,42}^{+6+8+10+12}$, . each term increases according to the pattern 6,8 , $10,12 \ldots$, i.e. the gap between terms is increasing by 2 .
$\Rightarrow$ the next three terms are $\left.\begin{array}{l}42+14=56 \\ 56+16=72 \\ 72+18=90\end{array}\right\} 56,72,90$
(iv) The white tile sequence is $0,2,6,12,20, \ldots$ and has a rectangular property $(0 \times 1),(1 \times 2),(2 \times 3),(3 \times 4),(4 \times 5), \ldots$
$\Rightarrow$ the next three terms are $(5 \times 6),(6 \times 7),(7 \times 8)$
$\begin{array}{lll}=30 & 42 & 56\end{array}$
[Note: This sequence could also be found by subtracting sequence (ii) from sequence (iii)]

## Section 9.2 Arithmetic sequences

A sequence in which each term changes by the same fixed amount is called an arithmetic sequence.
For example, $\quad \overbrace{3,7, \quad 11, \quad 15}^{+4}, \ldots$. each term increases by 4 .

$$
\overbrace{3,}^{-2}, \overbrace{1,-2}^{-2},-3, \ldots . . \text { each term decreases by } 2 .
$$

If we let the first term be $a\left(=T_{1}\right)$, and the difference between consecutive terms be $d$ (called the common difference), then every arithmetic sequence can be represented by
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-333.jpg?height=147&width=828&top_left_y=1077&top_left_x=437)

For the sequence: $\quad 3,7,11,15, \ldots$
$\left.\begin{array}{l}a=3 \\ d=7-3=4\end{array}\right\}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{n} & =a+(n-1) d \\
& =3+(n-1) 4 \\
& =3+4 n-4 \\
T_{n} & =4 n-1
\end{aligned}
$$

In every arithmetic sequence,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& T_{1}=a \\
& T_{2}-T_{1}=d \\
& T_{n}-T_{n-1}=d \\
& T_{n}=a+(n-1) d
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 1

Find the $n$th term ( $T_{n}$ ) of the arithmetic sequence:

$$
-2, \quad 3, \quad 8, \quad 13, \ldots .
$$

and hence find
(i) $T_{20}$
(ii) $T_{21}$
(iii) $T_{21}-T_{20}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left.\begin{array}{ll}
a & =-2 \\
d & =3-(-2)=5 \\
\text { (also, } d & =8-3=5)
\end{array}\right\} \\
& \therefore \quad T_{20}=5(20)-7 \text { and } \begin{aligned}
T_{21} & =5(21)-7 \\
& =93 \\
& =98
\end{aligned} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad T_{21}-T_{20}=98-93=5(=d) .
\end{aligned}
$$

The sequence $3,1,-1,-3, \ldots$ has an infinite number of terms.
The sequence $3,1,-1,-3, \ldots-35$ has a finite number of terms.
If we are given $T_{n}=-35$, we can find the number of terms ( $n$ ) in the sequence if we know the formula for $T_{n}$.

## Example 2

Find the number of terms in the sequence

$$
1, \quad-3, \quad-7, \quad-11, \quad \ldots \ldots . \quad-251 .
$$

In this sequence, $\left.\quad \begin{array}{rl}a & =1 \\ d & =-3-1=-4 \\ T_{n} & =-251\end{array}\right\}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{n} & =a+(n-1) d \\
-251 & =1+(n-1)(-4) \\
-251 & =1-4 n+4 \\
4 n & =256 \\
n & =\frac{256}{4}=64
\end{aligned}
$$

There are 64 terms in this sequence.

## Example 3

In an arithmetic sequence, $T_{4}=6$ and $3 T_{2}=T_{10}$, find the values of $a$ and $d$ and hence write out the first 6 terms of the sequence.

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{n} & =a+(n-1) d \\
T_{4} & =a+(4-1) d=a+3 d \\
T_{2} & =a+(2-1) d=a+d \\
T_{10} & =a+(10-1) d=a+9 d
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& T_{4}=6 \quad \text { and } \quad 3 T_{2}=T_{10} \\
& \Rightarrow a+3 d=6 \quad 3(a+d)=a+9 d \\
& 3 a+3 d=a+9 d \\
& 2 a-6 d=0 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad a-3 d=0
\end{aligned}
$$

Using simultaneous equations,

$$
\begin{aligned}
a-3 d & =0 \\
a+3 d & =6 \\
\hline 2 a \quad & =6 \ldots \text { adding both lines } \\
a & =3
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\text { Also, } \quad \begin{aligned}
a-3 d & =0 \\
3-3 d & =0 \\
-3 d & =-3 \\
d & =\left(\frac{-3}{-3}\right)=1
\end{aligned}
$$

The sequence is $3,4,5,6,7,8, \ldots$
> Given an arithmetic sequence $T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}, T_{4}, T_{5}, \ldots \ldots T_{n}$,

$$
T_{3}-T_{2}=T_{4}-T_{3}=T_{5}-T_{4}=\text { the common difference }(d) .
$$

In general terms:

$$
T_{n+1}-T_{n}=d \text { (the common difference). }
$$

A corollary to this is as follows:
To prove that a sequence is arithmetic, we must show that $T_{n+1}-T_{n}$ is a constant.
> Also, if $T_{n+1}-T_{n}>0$, then the sequence is increasing
if $T_{n+1}-T_{n}<0$, then the sequence is decreasing.
Note, to find $T_{n+1}$, substitute $(n+1)$ for $n$ in $T_{n}$.
If $T_{n}=3 n+1$,

$$
T_{n+1}=3(n+1)+1=3 n+4 .
$$

## Example 4

If $p+2,2 p+3$ and $5 p-2$ are three consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence, find the value of $p, p \in R$.

Because we have three consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad(2 p+3)-(p+2) & =(5 p-2)-(2 p+3) \\
2 p+3-p-2 & =5 p-2-2 p-3 \\
p+1 & =3 p-5 \\
-2 p & =-6 \\
p & =\left(\frac{-6}{-2}\right)=3 .
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: The three terms of the sequence are $5,9,13$.

## Example 5

Given (i) $T_{n}=\frac{n+1}{2}$
(ii) $T_{n}=\frac{2}{n+1}$, determine whether
(a) the sequence is arithmetic or not
(b) the sequence is increasing or decreasing.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { (i) } \begin{aligned}
T_{n} & =\frac{n+1}{2} \\
T_{n+1} & =\frac{(n+1)+1}{2} \\
& =\frac{n+2}{2} \\
T_{n+1}-T_{n} & =\frac{n+2}{2}-\frac{n+1}{2} \\
& =\frac{n+2-\not n-1}{2} \\
T_{n+1}-T_{n} & =\frac{1}{2} \\
\therefore \quad T_{n+1}- & T_{n} \text { is a constant } \\
\therefore \quad T_{n} \text { is an arithmetic sequence } & \\
\text { Also, since } & T_{n+1}-T_{n}=\frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned} \text {, } \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \text { i.e. }>0
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii)

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{n} & =\frac{2}{n+1} \\
T_{n+1} & =\frac{2}{(n+1)+1}=\frac{2}{n+2} \\
T_{n+1}-T_{n} & =\frac{2}{n+2}-\frac{2}{n+1} \\
& =\frac{2(n+1)-2(n+2)}{(n+2)(n+1)} \\
& =\frac{2 n+2-2 n-4}{(n+2)(n+1)} \\
T_{n+1}-T_{n} & =\frac{-2}{(n+2)(n+1)} \\
& \neq \text { constant } \ldots \text { since the } \\
& \text { value depends on } n .
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad T_{n}$ is not arithmetic
Also,
$T_{n+1}-T_{n}=\frac{-2}{(n+2)(n+1)}<0$.
Since $n \in \mathrm{~N}$ and is always positive, $\therefore \quad T_{n}$ is a decreasing sequence.

| Number of "hexagons" | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | $\ldots$ | $\ldots$ | 10 | $\ldots$ | () | $\ldots$ | $\ldots$ | $\ldots$ | 30 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

(i) Having finished a number of "hexagons", Sandrine counted 87 matchsticks left over. Has she enough to complete other designs with no matchsticks left over?
Explain your answer.
(ii) Prove that the sequence formed by the number of sticks in the shapes generates an arithmetic sequence.
(iii) Sandrine then decided to change her design to create a stacked hexagon pattern, removing the matchsticks in the centre.

## Section 9.3 Arithmetic series

When the terms of a sequence are added, a series is formed.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}, T_{4}, \ldots T_{n} \text { is a sequence } ; \text { e.g. } 3,6,9,12, \ldots \\
& T_{1}+T_{2}+T_{3}+T_{4}, \ldots+T_{n} \text { is a series } ; \text { e.g. } 3+6+9+12+\ldots
\end{aligned}
$$

We use $\boldsymbol{S}_{n}$ to represent the sum of $n$ terms of a series,

$$
\text { i.e. } S_{n}=T_{1}+T_{2}+T_{3}+T_{4}+\ldots T_{n}
$$

To find an expression for $S_{n}$, we note that in an arithmetic sequence,

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{n} & =a+(n-1) d \quad\left(\text { where } a=T_{1}, \text { the first term, and } d=\text { the common difference }\right) \\
\Rightarrow \quad T_{n-1} & =a+[(n-1)-1] d \\
& =a+(n-2) d \\
T_{3} & =a+2 d \\
T_{2} & =a+d \\
T_{1} & =a
\end{aligned}
$$

| Hence, | $S_{n}=$ | $T_{1}$ | $T_{2}$ | $T_{3}$ | $\ldots T_{n-1}$ | $T_{n}$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\Rightarrow$ | $S_{n}=$ | $a$ | $+a+d$ | $+a+2 d$ | $\ldots .+a+(n-2) d$ | $+a+(n-1) d$ |
| Also, | $S_{n}=$ | $a+(n-1) d$ | $+a+(n-2) d$ | $a+(n-3) d$ | $\ldots+a+d$ | $+a$ (reversing the order) |
| $\Rightarrow$ | $2 S_{n}=$ | $2 a+(n-1) d$ | $+2 a+(n-1) d$ | $2 a+(n-1) d$ | $\ldots .+2 a+(n-1) d$ | $+2 a+(n-1) d$ |

$\Rightarrow 2 S_{n}=n[2 a+(n-1)] d \ldots$ since there are $n$ identical terms in the sum.
$\Rightarrow \quad S_{n}=\frac{n}{2}[2 a+(n-1)] d \ldots$ where $a$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, $n$ is the number of terms.

## Example 1

Find the sum of the series $4+11+18+25+\ldots \ldots+144$.

Examining the series, we find: $a=4$

$$
d=11-4=7
$$

To find $n$, the number of terms up to the term 144, we use

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{n} & =a+(n-1) d \\
144 & =4+(n-1) 7=4+7 n-7 \\
144 & =7 n-3 \\
7 n & =147 \\
n & =\left(\frac{147}{7}\right)=21 \quad \ldots \text { i.e. there are } 21 \text { terms in this sequence. } \\
\therefore \quad & S_{n}=\frac{n}{2}\{2 a+(n-1) d\} \\
& S_{21}=\frac{21}{2}\{2(4)+(21-1) 7\} \\
& S_{21}=1554
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

To celebrate the birth of his niece, an uncle offers to open a savings account with a deposit of $€ 50$. He also offers to every year add $€ 10$ more than he did the previous year until his niece is 21 years of age.
(i) Find an expression for $S_{n}$, the sum of money on deposit after $n$ years.
(ii) Find $S_{21}$, the total saved after 21 years.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left.\begin{array}{l}
a=€ 50 \\
d=€ 10
\end{array}\right\} \quad S_{n} & =\frac{n}{2}\{2 a+(n-1) d\} \\
& =\frac{n}{2}\{2(50)+(n-1) 10\} \\
& \left.=\frac{n}{2}\{100+10 n-10)\right\} \\
\Rightarrow \quad S_{n} & =\frac{n}{2}\{10 n+90\} \\
S_{21} & =\frac{21}{2}\{10(21)+90\}=€ 3150
\end{aligned}
$$

We note that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \quad S_{1}=T_{1} \\
& \quad S_{2}=T_{1}+T_{2} \\
& \quad S_{3}=T_{1}+T_{2}+T_{3} \\
& \therefore S_{3}-S_{2}=\quad T_{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

Given $S_{n}$ to find $T_{n}$ :

$$
S_{n}-S_{n-1}=T_{n}
$$

Generally,

$$
S_{n}-S_{n-1}=T_{n}
$$

## Example 3

Given $S_{n}=n^{2}-4 n$, find an expression for $T_{n}$ and hence determine if the sequence is arithmetic.

$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{n} & =n^{2}-4 n \\
S_{n-1} & =(n-1)^{2}-4(n-1) \ldots \text { replace } n \text { with } n-1 \\
& =n^{2}-2 n+1-4 n+4 \\
\Rightarrow S_{n-1} & =n^{2}-6 n+5 \\
T_{n} & =S_{n}-S_{n-1}=n^{2}-4 n-\left(n^{2}-6 n+5\right) \\
& =n^{2}-4 n-n^{2}+6 n-5 . \\
T_{n} & =2 n-5
\end{aligned}
$$

If a sequence is arithmetic, $T_{n}-T_{n-1}$ must be a constant.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad T_{n}-T_{n-1} & =2 n-5-[2(n-1)-5] \\
& =2 n-5-(2 n-7) \\
& =2 n-5-2 n+7 \\
& =2, \text { i.e. a constant. }
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore the sequence is arithmetic.

## Example 4

A lighting company is making a sequence of light panels with the number of bulbs per panel in arithmetic sequence.
For the first 10 panels, 165 bulbs were used.
If the third panel is as shown in the diagram, find $a$, the first term of the sequence, and $d$, the common difference.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-340.jpg?height=209&width=209&top_left_y=1857&top_left_x=803)

3rd panel (9 bulbs)
Hence draw a diagram of the first four panels.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\begin{array}{l}
T_{n}=a+(n-1) d \\
T_{3}=a+(3-1) d
\end{array} & \text { Also, } S_{n}=\frac{n}{2}\{2 a+(n-1) d\} \\
T_{3}=a+2 d=9 & \ldots . \text { we know that } S_{n}=165 \text { when } n=10 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad S_{10}=\frac{10}{2}\{2 a+(10-1) d\} \\
& \qquad \begin{aligned}
& S_{10}=10 a+45 d=165 . \\
& \Rightarrow 10 a+2 d=9
\end{aligned} \\
\text { and } & \begin{aligned}
10 a+45 d & =165 \\
\Rightarrow & -25 d=-75
\end{aligned} \text {... subtracting } \\
\Rightarrow & d=\left(\frac{-75}{-25}\right)=3
\end{array}
$$

If $d=3$, then $a+2(3)=9$

$$
\Rightarrow a=3
$$

The sequence of bulbs in the panels is $3,6,9,12$.

## Sigma ( $\Sigma$ ) notation

An efficient way of representing a series is to use the sigma notation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S_{n}=T_{1}+T_{2}+T_{3}+T_{4}+\ldots . T_{n} \\
& \quad=\sum_{r=1}^{n} T_{r} \text { which reads as the sum of all the values of } T_{r} \text { as } r \text { changes from } 1 \text { to } n \text {. } \\
& \sum_{r=1}^{6}(2 r+1)=3+5+7+9+11+13(n=6 \text { terms }) \\
& \begin{aligned}
\sum_{r=2}^{5} \frac{r^{2}}{3}=\frac{4}{3}+\frac{9}{3}+\frac{16}{3}+\frac{25}{3}(n=4 \text { terms }) & \\
\sum_{r=0}^{4} r(r+1) & =0(0+1)+1(1+1)+2(2+1)+3(3+1)+4(4+1) \\
& =0 \\
& \sum_{r=1}^{4}=\text { the sum of } \\
\sum_{r=1}^{4} T_{r} & \text { is the sum of } T_{1}+T_{2}+T_{3}+T_{4}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 5

(i) Use the sigma notation ( $\sum$ ) to represent $2+6+10+14+\ldots$. for 45 terms.
(ii) For what value of $n$ is $\sum_{r=1}^{n}(3 r-5)=90$ ?
(iii) Find the value of $\sum_{r=1}^{8}(4 r-1)$.
(i) $2+6+10+\ldots \ldots a=2\} \quad T_{n}=a+(n-1) d$
$d=4\} \quad=2+(n-1) 4$
$T_{n}=4 n-2$

$$
\Rightarrow \quad T_{r}=4 r-2 .
$$

$\therefore 2+6+10+\ldots$. for 45 terms $=\sum_{r=1}^{r=45}(4 r-2)$
(ii) $\begin{aligned} \sum_{r=1}^{n}(3 r-5) & =[3(1)-5]+[3(2)-5]+[3(3)-5)]+\ldots \ldots 3 n-5 \\ & =-2+1+4+\ldots 3 n-5 .\end{aligned}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow n-9=0 \text { or } 3 n+20=0 \\
& \therefore \quad n=9 \text { or } n=\frac{-20}{3} \\
& \therefore \quad n=9 \text { since } n \in N
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
S_{n}=90 \quad 90=\frac{n}{2}\{2(-2)+(n-1)(3)\}
$$

$$
180=n(-4+3 n-3)
$$

$$
180=n(3 n-7)
$$

(iii) $\sum_{r=1}^{8}(4 r-1)=3+7+11+\ldots \ldots(n=8$ terms $)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left.\begin{array}{l}

\therefore & S_{n}=\frac{n}{2}\{2 a+(n-1) d\} \\
& S_{8}=\frac{8}{2}\{2(3)+(8-1) 4\} \\

\end{aligned} \\
\therefore \sum_{r=1}^{8}(4 r-1)=136 &

## Section 9.4 Geometric sequences

A geometric sequence is formed when each term of the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed amount.

For example,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-344.jpg?height=226&width=904&top_left_y=1402&top_left_x=465)

For any geometric sequence, the first term is denoted by $a$ and the ratio between consecutive terms is $r$ (called the common ratio); then every geometric sequence can be represented by
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-344.jpg?height=152&width=866&top_left_y=1765&top_left_x=439)

Consider the sequence:

$$
\left.=\begin{array}{cccccc}
2, & 6, & 18, & 54, & \ldots . . & a . r^{n-1} \\
2, & 2 \times 3, & 2 \times 3^{2}, & 2 \times 3^{3}, & \ldots . . & 2 \times 3^{n-1}
\end{array}\right\} \quad \begin{aligned}
a & =2 \\
r & =\frac{6}{2}=3 \\
T_{n} & =a r^{n-1} \\
T_{n} & =2.3^{n-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 1

Find $T_{n}$ and $T_{10}$ of the geometric sequence $1, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{64}, \ldots$
In every geometric sequence:

$$
\left.\begin{array}{l}
a=1 \\
r=\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{1}=\frac{1}{4}
\end{array}\right\} \begin{aligned}
T_{n} & =a \cdot r^{n-1} \\
& =1 \cdot\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{n-1} \\
& =\frac{1}{4^{n-1}} \\
T_{n} & =4^{-n+1}=4^{1-n} \\
T_{10} & =4^{1-10}=4^{-9}=\frac{1}{262144}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{1} & =a \\
\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}} & =r \\
T_{n} & =a r^{n-1} \\
\frac{T_{n+1}}{T_{n}} & =r
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

In a geometric sequence, $T_{3}=32$ and $T_{6}=4$.
Find $a$ and $r$ and hence write down the first six terms of the sequence.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& T_{n}=a \cdot r^{n-1} \\
& T_{3}=a \cdot r^{3-1}=a r^{2}=32 \\
& T_{6}=a \cdot r^{6-1}=a r^{5}=4
\end{aligned}
$$

Dividing these terms:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d r^{5}}{d r^{2}} & =\frac{4}{32} \\
r^{3} & =\frac{1}{8} \\
r & =\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{8}}=\frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { If } \quad r & =\frac{1}{2}, \\
\text { then } \quad a r^{2} & =32 \\
\Rightarrow \quad a \cdot\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) & =32 \\
a & =128 .
\end{aligned}
$$

The sequence is $128,64,32,16,8,4$.

## Note:

> Given three consecutive terms of a geometric sequence, $T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}$, we note that $\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}=\frac{T_{3}}{T_{2}}=($ common ratio, $r)$.
$>$ We also note that $\frac{a}{r}, a, a r$ are three consecutive terms of a geometric sequence, with first term $\frac{a}{r}$ and common ratio $r$.
Multiplying these terms gives $\frac{a}{x} \times a \times a r=a^{3}$, i.e. the cube of the middle term.
For example: $2,6,18$ are in geometric sequence,

$$
\Rightarrow 2 \times 6 \times 18=216=6^{3}
$$

Also, $1, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{16}$ are in geometric sequence,

$$
\Rightarrow \quad 1 \times \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{16}=\frac{1}{64}=\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{3}
$$

## Example 3

$3, x, x+6, \ldots$ are the first three terms of a geometric sequence of positive terms.
Find
(i) the value of $x$
(ii) the tenth term of the sequence.
(i) For a geometric sequence, $\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}=\frac{T_{3}}{T_{2}}$, i.e., $\frac{x}{3}=\frac{x+6}{x}$

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & x^{2}=3 x+18 \\
\therefore & x^{2}-3 x-18=0 \\
\therefore & (x-6)(x+3)=0 \\
\Rightarrow & x=6 \text { or } x=-3
\end{array}
$$

$x=6$ since the terms are positive $\Rightarrow$ sequence is $3,6,12, \ldots$
(ii) $T_{n}=a \cdot r^{n-1}$
$T_{10}=a . r^{10-1}=a . r^{9}=3.2^{9}=1536$

## Example 4

The product of the first three terms of a geometric sequence is 216 and their sum is 21 . Given that the common ratio $r$ is less than 1 , find the first three terms of the sequence.

Let $\frac{a}{r}, a, a r$ be the first three terms.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad \frac{a}{r} \times a \times a r & =a^{3}=216 \\
\Rightarrow \quad a & =\sqrt[3]{216}=6
\end{aligned}
$$

Also, $\quad \frac{a}{r}+a+a r=21$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{6}{r}+6+6 r & =21 \\
\frac{6}{r}+6 r-15 & =0 \\
6+6 r^{2}-15 r & =0 \\
\therefore \quad 6 r^{2}-15 r+6 & =0 \\
(2 r-1)(r-2) & =0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad r=\frac{1}{2} \text { or } r & =2
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $r<1 \Rightarrow r=\frac{1}{2}$.
Therefore the first three terms are $\frac{a}{r}, a, a r=\frac{6}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}, 6,6\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=12,6,3$.

## Example 5

Find the number of terms in the geometric sequence $81,27,9, \ldots \frac{1}{27}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\left.\begin{array}{rl}
a=81 \\
r=\frac{27}{81}=\frac{1}{3}
\end{array}\right\} \quad \text { Let } \quad \begin{aligned}
T_{n} & =\frac{1}{27} \\
\mathrm{~T}_{n} & =a \cdot r^{n-1} \\
& =81 \cdot\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{n-1}=\frac{1}{27}
\end{aligned} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{3^{n-1}}=\frac{1}{27 \times 81} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad 3^{n-1}=27 \times 81 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad 3^{n-1}=3^{3} \times 3^{4}=3^{7}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: When solving an equation such as $4^{n-1}=4096$, we can use two different methods.

Method A: Express 4096 as a power of 4 using a calculator and trial and error.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad 4^{n-1} & =4096=4^{6} \\
n-1 & =6 \\
n & =7
\end{aligned}
$$

Method B: Using logs (see chapter 12)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 4^{n-1}=4096 \\
\Rightarrow \quad & n-1=\log _{4} 4096 \\
\Rightarrow \quad & \begin{array}{l}
\text { Definition of logs: } \\
\text { If } a^{x}=y \\
\text { then } \log _{a} y=x
\end{array} \\
& \therefore \quad n-1=6 \text { (using the }{ }_{\text {calculator })} \text {. } \\
\therefore \quad & n=7
\end{aligned}
$$

## Exponential sequences

Exponential functions of the form $y=\mathrm{A} a^{x}$, where A is the initial value and $a$ the multiplier or common ratio, produce geometric sequences.

Consider a ball dropping from a height of 10 m .
If the ball bounces back to $\frac{2}{3}$ of its original height on each bounce, the height of the ball is given by the following pattern:
After 1 bounce: $\quad 10 \times \frac{2}{3}=10\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{1}$
After 2 bounces: $10 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}=10\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{2}$
After 3 bounces: $\quad 10 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}=10\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{3}$
After $n$ bounces: $10 \times\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-347.jpg?height=606&width=659&top_left_y=1616&top_left_x=972)

## Example 6

A ball is dropped from a height of 27 m and loses $\frac{2}{3}$ of its height on each bounce.
(i) Find the height of the ball on each of its first four bounces.
(ii) Hence write down the height of the ball after the $10^{\text {th }}$ bounce.
(iii) After which bounce will the ball be at most 2.5 m above the ground?
(i) After the 1st bounce, the ball is $27 \times \frac{1}{3}=9 \mathrm{~m}$ above the ground.

After the 2nd bounce, the ball is $27 \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3}=3 \mathrm{~m}$.
After the 3rd bounce, the ball is $27 \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3}=1 \mathrm{~m}$.
After the 4th bounce, the ball is $27 \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{3} \mathrm{~m}$.
(ii) After the 10 th bounce, the ball is $27 \times\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{n}=27 \times\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{10}=0.00046 \mathrm{~m}$.
(iii) To find $n$, the number of bounces needed to produce a height of 2.5 m , let $\quad 27 \times\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{n}=2.5$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{n} & =0.093 \\
\ln \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{n} & =\ln (0.093) \\
n \ln \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) & =\ln (0.093) \quad \Rightarrow n=\left(\frac{\ln (0.093)}{\ln \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}\right)=2.16 \text { bounces. }
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the number of bounces of a ball has to be a discrete (whole) number, after two bounces the ball will be above 2.5 m .
Therefore it will require three bounces of the ball to guarantee the ball is below 2.5 m .

## Section 9.5 Limits of sequences

As the number of terms in the sequence becomes very large, in some cases the terms of the sequence converge to a fixed value which we call the limit of the sequence.

If such a limit exists, the sequence is said to be convergent.
A sequence which does converge is said to be divergent.
The sequence $0.3,0.33,0.333,0.3333, \ldots$ converges to $1 / 3$.

Consider the sequence $T_{n}=\frac{n+2}{n^{2}}, n \in N$ as $n$ increases the value of $\frac{n+2}{n^{2}}$ tends to zero.

We write this as $n \rightarrow \infty, T_{n} \rightarrow 0$.
i.e. $\mathrm{n}^{\text {th }}$ term of the sequence $3,1, \frac{5}{9}, \frac{6}{16}, \frac{7}{25}, \ldots$ "tends to" zero.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-351.jpg?height=581&width=663&top_left_y=169&top_left_x=965)

Note: Although the $\mathrm{n}^{\text {th }}$ term ( $T_{n}$ ) never becomes zero, by taking $n$ large enough we can make the difference between $T_{n}$ and zero so small, it is negligible.

In chapter 7 we have already stated that
$\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n}=0$ and therefore $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{k}{n}=0$

## Limit notation

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} T_{n}=L
$$

States that as $n$ gets close to $\infty$, $T_{n}$ approaches the value $L$.

Also $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{k}{n^{p}}=0$ where $p>0$ the following rules, as $n \rightarrow \infty$, should also be noted.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} C & =C \\
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(T_{n}+R_{n}\right) & =\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(T_{n}\right)+\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(R_{n}\right) \\
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(T_{n} \times R_{n}\right) & =\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(T_{n}\right) \times \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(R_{n}\right) \\
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{T_{n}}{R_{n}}\right) & =\frac{\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} T_{n}}{\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} R_{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

1. The limit of a constant $C$ is $C$
2. The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits.
3. The limit of a product is the product of the limits
4. The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits

In practice (as in Ch 7 ) to evaluate the limit of a fraction, divide both numerator and denominator by the highest power of $n$ in the expression, and then use the appropriate rule above. Remember: $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{k}{n^{p}}=0$.

## Example 1

Evaluate
(i) $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{3 n^{2}}{n^{2}+5}\right)$
(ii) $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{n^{3}-4 n}{n^{2}-2}\right)$
(iii) $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{n^{2}+4 n}{n^{4}-2 n^{3}}\right)$
(i) $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{3 n^{2}}{n^{2}+5}\right)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{3}{1+\frac{5}{n^{2}}}\right)$
(dividing above and below by $n^{2}$ )

$$
=\frac{3}{1+0}=3 \quad\left(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{5}{n^{2}}=0\right)
$$

(ii) $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{n^{3}-4 n}{n^{2}-2}\right)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{1-\frac{4}{n^{3}}}{\frac{1}{n}-\frac{2}{n^{3}}}\right) \quad$ (dividing above and below by $n^{3}$ ) $=\frac{1-0}{0-0}=\frac{1}{0}=\infty$ i.e. there is no limit
(iii) $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{n^{2}+4 n}{n^{4}-2 n^{3}}\right)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{4}{n^{2}}}{1-\frac{2}{n}}\right) \quad$ (dividing above and below by $n^{4}$ ) $=\frac{0-0}{1-0}=\frac{0}{1}=0$

(ii) $\frac{5 n-4}{n-4}$
(iii) $\frac{n^{2}+2}{n^{2}-4}$
2. Evaluate each of the following:
(i) $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n^{3}+2 n}{2 n^{3}-4 n^{2}+3 n}$
(ii) $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{8}{n(n-6)}$

(iii) $T_{n}=\frac{7 n^{3}}{n^{2}+3 n-4}$
6. Find the limit as $n \rightarrow \infty$ of $T_{n}=\frac{a n^{p}+c n^{q}}{b n^{p}+d n^{s}}$ where $p>q>s$.

## Section 9.6 Geometric series

When the terms of a geometric sequence are added, a geometric series is created.
For example, $2+6+18+54+\ldots$ is a geometric series.
To find the sum of a series, $a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}+\ldots$ we consider a sequence of partial sums where $S_{1}=a_{1}, S_{2}=a_{1}+a_{2}, S_{3}=a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}$ and $S_{n}=a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+\ldots . a_{n}$.

To find a formula for $S_{n}$, we use the following procedure:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{S}_{n} & =a+a r+a r^{2}+\ldots . . a r^{n-3}+a r^{n-2}+a r^{n-1} \\
\Rightarrow r \cdot S_{n} & =a r+a r^{2}+\ldots . a r^{n-3}+a r^{n-2}+a r^{n-1}+a r^{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

... multiplying
Subtracting: $\quad S_{n}-r S_{n}=a-a r^{n}$ each term by $r$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad S_{n}(1-r) & =a\left(1-r^{n}\right) \\
\therefore \quad S_{n} & =\frac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r}
\end{aligned}
$$

The sum to $n$ terms of a geometric sequence,

$$
\mathrm{S}_{n}=\frac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r}, \text { where } a \text { is the first term and } r \text { is the common ratio. }
$$

## Example 1

Find $T_{5}$ and $S_{5}$ of each of the following:
(i) $1+3+9+\ldots$
(ii) $1+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{16}+\ldots$
(i) $\left.\begin{array}{rl}a & =1 \\ r & =\frac{3}{1}=3\end{array}\right\}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{n} & =a r^{n-1} \\
T_{n} & =1.3^{n-1} \\
& =3^{n-1} \\
\therefore \quad T_{5} & =3^{5-1} \\
& =3^{4} \\
& =81
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{n} & =\frac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r} \\
& =\frac{1\left(1-3^{n}\right)}{1-3} \\
& =\frac{1-3^{n}}{-2} \\
S_{n} & =\frac{3^{n}-1}{2} \\
\therefore \quad S_{5} & =\frac{3^{5}-1}{2}=121
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii)

$$
\left.\begin{array}{l}
a=1 \\
r=\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{1}=\frac{1}{4}
\end{array}\right\} \begin{aligned}
T_{n} & =a r^{n-1} \\
& =1 .\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{n-1} \\
T_{n} & =\frac{1}{4^{n-1}} \\
\therefore \quad T_{5} & =\frac{1}{4^{5-1}} \\
T_{5} & =\frac{1}{4^{4}} \\
& =\frac{1}{256}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{n} & =\frac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r} \\
& =\frac{1\left(1-\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{n}\right)}{1-\frac{1}{4}} \\
& =\frac{1-\frac{1}{4^{n}}}{\frac{3}{4}} \\
S_{n} & =\frac{4}{3}\left(1-\frac{1}{4^{n}}\right) \\
\therefore \quad S_{5} & =\frac{4}{3}\left(1-\frac{1}{4^{5}}\right)=\frac{341}{256}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

In a geometric series, $T_{3}=32$ and $T_{6}=4$; find $a$ and $r$ and hence find $S_{8}$, the sum of the first eight terms.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& T_{n}=a r^{n-1} \\
& T_{3}=a r^{3-1}=a r^{2}=32 \\
& T_{6}=a r^{6-1}=a r^{5}=4
\end{aligned}
$$

Dividing these equations, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{a r^{2}}{a r^{5}} & =\frac{32}{4} \\
\frac{1}{r^{3}} & =8 \\
r^{3} & =\frac{1}{8} \\
r & =\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{8}}=\frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

If $\quad r=\frac{1}{2}$, then $a\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}=32$

$$
\begin{aligned}
a\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) & =32 \\
a & =128 .
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad S_{n} & =\frac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r} \\
& =\frac{128\left(1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}\right)}{1-\frac{1}{2}} \\
S_{n} & =256\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{n}}\right) \\
S_{8} & =256\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{8}}\right) \\
& =255
\end{aligned}
$$

It is very important to understand the effect the value of $r$ has on the sum of a geometric series. Consider three geometric sequences $-A, B$ and $C-$ where $A$ has a common ratio of $r=2, B$ has a common ratio of $r=1$, and $C$ has a common ratio of $r=\frac{1}{2}$.
Starting with a first term value of 1 , we get:

| Sequence | $\boldsymbol{r}$ | $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{1}}$ | $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{2}}$ | $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{3}}$ | $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{4}}$ | $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{5}}$ | $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{6}}$ | $\cdots \boldsymbol{⿱}$ | $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{1 0 0}}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $A$ | 2 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 |  | $6.3 \times 10^{29}$ |
| $B$ | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |  | 1 |
| $C$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ | 1 | $\frac{1}{2}$ | $\frac{1}{4}$ | $\frac{1}{8}$ | $\frac{1}{16}$ | $\frac{1}{32}$ |  | $1.6 \times 10^{-30}$ |

$\Rightarrow$| Series | $\boldsymbol{r}$ | $\boldsymbol{S}_{\mathbf{1}}$ | $\boldsymbol{S}_{\mathbf{2}}$ | $\boldsymbol{S}_{\mathbf{3}}$ | $\boldsymbol{S}_{\mathbf{4}}$ | $\boldsymbol{S}_{\mathbf{5}}$ | $\boldsymbol{S}_{\mathbf{6}}$ | $\cdots \cdots$ | $\boldsymbol{S}_{\mathbf{1 0 0}}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $A$ | 2 | 1 | 3 | 7 | 15 | 31 | 63 |  | $1.3 \times 10^{30}$ |
| $B$ | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |  | 100 |
| $C$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ | 1 | 1.5 | 1.75 | 1.875 | 1.9375 | 1.96875 |  | 2 |

If $|r|>1$, the values of $T_{n}$ and $S_{n}$, as $n$ gets bigger, increase very rapidly.
If $|r|=1$, then the sequence behaves like an arithmetic sequence with a constant amount added each term.

If $|r|<1$, then the value of $S_{n}$ is said to have a "limiting value".
In series $C$ above, the sum $S_{n}$ approaches the value 2 .
By taking a sufficiently large value of $n$, we can make $S_{n}$ as near to 2 as we wish, that is, we can make $2-S_{n}$ as small as we wish.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-355.jpg?height=720&width=840&top_left_y=168&top_left_x=794)

We say that $S_{n}$ approaches a limiting value of $\mathbf{2}$ as $\boldsymbol{n}$ approaches infinity.
This is written as: $\quad S_{n} \rightarrow 2$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ or $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} S_{n}=2$.
In words, we say that "the limit of the partial sum $S_{n}$, as $n$ tends to infinity, is 2."
Now consider the formula for the sum to $n$ terms of a geometric series if $|r|<1$.

$$
S_{n}=\frac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r}
$$

When $|r|<1, r^{n}$ will approximate to zero for large values of $n$, i.e. $r^{n} \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
Thus, $\quad S_{n}=\frac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{1-r}$ becomes $S_{n}=\frac{a(1-0)}{1-r}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad S_{n} & =\frac{a}{1-r} \quad \text { as } \quad n \rightarrow \infty . \\
\text { or } \quad \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} S_{n} & =\frac{a}{1-r}
\end{aligned}
$$

For a geometric series with $|r|<1$,

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} S_{n}=\frac{a}{1-r}
$$

## Example 3

Find the sum to infinity of the geometric series $16+12+9+\ldots \ldots$

$$
\left.\begin{array}{rl}
a & =16 \\
r & =\frac{12}{16}=\frac{3}{4}
\end{array}\right\} \Rightarrow \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} S_{n}=\frac{a}{1-r}=\frac{16}{1-\frac{3}{4}}=64
$$

## Recurring decimals

Recurring decimals can be expressed as a sum to infinity of a geometric sequence, where the common ratio $r<1$.

For example, $0 . \dot{3}=0.3333 \ldots .=\overbrace{\frac{3}{10}+\frac{3}{10^{2}}+\frac{3}{10^{3}}+\frac{3}{10^{4}}}^{\times \frac{1}{10}}+\ldots$.
where $\quad a=0.3$ and $r=\frac{1}{10}$.
Similarly,

$$
\begin{aligned}
0.2 \dot{3} \dot{5}=0.2353535 \ldots \ldots & =0.2+[0.035+0.00035+\ldots .] \\
& =0.2+\frac{35}{1000}+\frac{35}{100000}+\ldots . \\
& =0.2+\text { an infinite geometric series } \\
\text { where } \quad a & =\frac{35}{1000} \quad \text { and } \quad r=\frac{1}{100} .
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 4

Write the recurring decimal $0 . \dot{2} \dot{3}$ as a fraction in the form $\frac{a}{b}, a, b, \in N$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 . \dot{2} \dot{3}=0.232323 \ldots \ldots & =0.23+0.0023+0.000023+\ldots \ldots \\
& =\frac{23}{100}+\frac{23}{10000}+\frac{23}{1000000}+\ldots \ldots \\
\Rightarrow \quad a=\frac{23}{100} \text { and } \quad r & =\frac{23}{10000} \div \frac{23}{100}=\frac{1}{100} \\
\Rightarrow \quad \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} S_{n}=\frac{a}{1-r} & =\frac{\frac{23}{100}}{1-\frac{1}{100}}=\frac{23}{100} \times \frac{100}{99}=\frac{23}{99}
\end{aligned}
$$

[Note: $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} S_{n}$ is often written as $S_{\infty}$. Thus, $S_{\infty}=\frac{23}{99}$ ]

Note: If we let $x=0.232323 \ldots$,
then $100 x=23.232323 \ldots$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad 99 x & =23 \ldots \text { subtracting both lines } \\
\therefore \quad x & =\frac{23}{99}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 9.7 Other sequences

In some cases terms of a sequence might be defined as a function of preceding terms:
(i) $T_{n+1}=2 T_{n}+2$ where $T_{1}=2$
(ii) $T_{n+2}=T_{n+1}-T_{n}$ where $T_{1}=3$ and $T_{2}=1$

In each case a relationship between terms is given and a starting value $T_{1}$ (or $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ )
These are referred to as recurrence relations.

## Example 1

Write out the first five terms of the sequence defined by

$$
T_{n+2}=T_{n+1}+T_{n}, \text { where } T_{1}=1 \text { and } T_{2}=2
$$

Let $n=1, \Rightarrow T_{1+2}=T_{1+1}+T_{1} \quad \therefore \quad T_{3}=T_{2}+T_{1}=2+1=3$
Let $n=2, \Rightarrow T_{2+2}=T_{2+1}+T_{2} \quad \therefore \quad T_{4}=T_{3}+T_{2}=3+2=5$
Let $n=3, \Rightarrow T_{3+2}=T_{3+1}+T_{3} \quad \therefore \quad T_{5}=T_{4}+T_{3}=5+3=8$
The first five terms are $1,2,3,5,8$.

## Example 2

Write out the first four terms of the sequence defined by

$$
T_{n+1}=2 T_{n}+1, \text { given that } T_{1}=1
$$

Let $n=2, \Rightarrow T_{2+1}=2 T_{2}+1 \quad \therefore \quad T_{3}=2 T_{2}+1=2(3)+1=7$
Let $n=3, \Rightarrow T_{3+1}=2 T_{3}+1 \quad \therefore \quad T_{4}=2 T_{3}+1=2(7)+1=15$
The first five terms are $1,3,7,15$.

(iii) $G_{1}=0, G_{2}=1, G_{n}=3 G_{n-1}-G_{n-2}$
3. Write down the first five terms of the sequence formed from the recurrence relation defined by

(i) $T_{1}=1, T_{2}=3$ given that $T_{n}=3 T_{n-1}-T_{n-2}$ for $n>2$
(ii) $T_{1}=5$ and $T_{n+1}=T_{n}-2$
6. Find the first five terms of the sequence formed from the recurrence relation $G_{1}=2$ and $G_{n+1}=\left(G_{n}-2\right)^{2}$
7. The pattern of triangles given below can be described in two ways using recurrence relations:
(i) For the number of triangles, $T_{n+1}=T_{n}+2, T_{1}=1$
(ii) For the number of sides $S_{n+1}=S_{n}+4, S_{1}=3$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-358.jpg?height=159&width=778&top_left_y=1590&top_left_x=673)

(d) Find the number of sides in the $20^{\text {th }}$ pattern, $S_{20}$

## Section 9.8 Number patterns - Revisited

## Linear, Quadratic and Cubic patterns

In our study of algebra, we discovered that we can identify patterns in certain number sequences by calculating differences.

The sequence $-4,0,4,8,12, \ldots$ has a first difference of +4 creating a formula for $T_{n}=4 n+a$, where $n=1,2,3, \ldots$. etc.

| Sequence | -4 | 0 | 4 | 8 | 12 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1st difference |  | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 |

Therefore, if $n=1$, then $T_{1}=4(1)+a=-4$

$$
\Rightarrow \quad a=-8
$$

$\therefore \quad$ A constant first difference gives rise to an arithmetic (linear) pattern, $T_{n}=4 n-8$.
As the following table indicates, the sequence $7,17,31,49,71, \ldots$... does not have a constant first difference.

| Sequence | 7 | 17 | 31 | 49 | 71 |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1st difference | 10 | 14 | 18 | 22 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2nd difference | 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 4 | 4 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

A constant second difference indicates a quadratic ( $n^{2}$ ) pattern, $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{n}^{\mathbf{2}}+\boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{n}+\boldsymbol{c}$.
Consider $T_{n}=a n^{2}+b n+c$ for all values of $n \geqslant 1$.
The following table evaluates the first and second differences in terms of $a, b$ and $c$.

| $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{1}}$ | $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{2}}$ | $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{3}}$ | $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{4}}$ | $\boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{5}}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $a+b+c$ | $4 a+2 b+c$ | $9 a+3 b+c$ | $16 a+4 b+c$ | $25 a+5 b+c$ |


| $3 a+b+c$ | $5 a+b+c$ | $7 a+b+c$ | $9 a+b+c$ | 1st difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $2 a$ |  | $2 a$ | $2 a$ | 2nd difference |

From this table we can see that the second difference of a quadratic pattern of numbers is always $2 a$, twice the coefficient of $n^{2}$.
$\therefore \quad$ if the second difference is $+4 \Rightarrow 2 a=4$

$$
a=2
$$

$\therefore \quad T_{n}=2 n^{2}+b n+c$ for $n=1,2,3$, etc.
To find $b$ and $c$, we use simultaneous equations as follows.

$$
T_{n}=2 n^{2}+b n+c \text { for } n=1,2,3, \text { etc. }
$$

Let $n=1, T_{1}=2(1)^{2}+b(1)+c=7$

$$
\Rightarrow b+c=5
$$

Let $n=2, T_{2}=2(2)^{2}+b(2)+c=17$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad 2 b+c & =9 \\
b+c & =5 \\
\hline \therefore \quad b & =4
\end{aligned}
$$

If $\quad b=4$, then $4+c=5$,

$$
\Rightarrow \quad c=1
$$

$\therefore \quad T_{n}=2 n^{2}+4 n+1$ for $n=1,2,3$, etc.

The method of finite differences can be used to study patterns of numbers with higher powers.
If the third difference is constant we have a cubic pattern, $T_{n}=a n^{3}+b n^{2}+c n+d$ etc.

|  | Pattern | To find $\boldsymbol{a}$ |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| 1st difference constant | $T_{n}=a n+b$ | $a=1$ st difference |
| 2nd difference constant | $T_{n}=a n^{2}+b n+c$ | $2 a=2$ nd difference |
| 3rd difference constant | $T_{n}=a n^{3}+b n^{2}+c n+d$ | $6 a=3$ rd difference |

## Example 1

Express the $n$th term of the number pattern $-1,13,51,125,247, \ldots$ as a cubic polynomial.

Since the 3rd difference is constant, the number pattern has a cubic part and $6 a=$ third difference.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad a=\frac{1}{6} \times 12=2 \\
& \therefore \quad T_{n}=2 n^{3}+b n^{2}+c n+d \text { for } n \geqslant 1 \\
& T_{1}=2+b+c+d=-1 \\
& \quad \Rightarrow \quad b+c+d=-3 \\
& T_{2}=2(2)^{3}+b(2)^{2}+c(2)+d=13 \\
& \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4 b+2 c+d=-3 \\
& T_{3}=2(3)^{3}+b(3)^{2}+c(3)+d=51 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad 9 b+3 c+d=-3
\end{aligned}
$$

| Sequence | -1 | 13 | 51 | 125 | 247 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1st difference | 14 | 38 | 74 | 122 |  |
| 2nd difference | 24 |  | 36 | 48 |  |
| 3rd difference | 12 |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | 12 |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

Solving the equations:

1. $b+c+d=-3$
2. $4 b+2 c+d=-3$
3. $9 b+3 c+d=-3$
we get $b=0, c=0, d=-3$
$\therefore \quad T_{n}=2 n^{3}-3$ for $n \geqslant 1$.

## Example 2

A mosaic arrangement is constructed on a floor as shown.
Find the number of tiles needed for the 30th pattern.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-360.jpg?height=254&width=709&top_left_y=1729&top_left_x=636)

The number of tiles required forms the pattern $1,3,6,10, \ldots$
Checking differences, we find a constant 2nd difference.
Therefore, a quadratic pattern $T_{n}=a n^{2}+b n+c$ - exists.

| Sequence | 1 | 3 | 6 | 10 |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1st difference | 2 | 3 | 4 |  |  |
| 2nd difference |  | 1 | 1 |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

And $\quad 2 a=1 \Rightarrow a=\frac{1}{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad T_{n}=\frac{1}{2} n^{2}+b n+c & \\
& T_{1}=\frac{1}{2}(1)^{2}+b(1)+c=1 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad b+c=\frac{1}{2} \\
& T_{2}=\frac{1}{2}(2)^{2}+b(2)+c=3 \\
\Rightarrow \quad 2 b+c & =1
\end{aligned}
$$

Solving these equations, we find

$$
\begin{array}{ll}

## Introduction to statistics

The aim of statistics is to help us make sense of large amounts of information or data. In pursuit of this aim, statistics divides the study of data into three parts:
(i) Collecting data
(ii) Describing and presenting data
(iii) Drawing conclusions from data.

In this chapter, we will discuss the variety of ways that information or data can be collected. These include questionnaires, experiments and observations. Once data has been gathered, we must then concern ourselves with the description of data so that ordinary people can understand it. We can do this by representing the data graphically. You will meet a variety of graphical methods in this chapter, as shown below. These are known as descriptive statistics.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-368.jpg?height=656&width=1397&top_left_y=1565&top_left_x=209)

Another way of making a large amount of data easily understood is by summarising the data. Data may be summarised by simply finding an average or some other number that could be representative of the data as a whole. These numbers are known as summary statistics.

One of the most widely-used and important statistical processes is concerned with gathering information from a small group of people (or items) and using this data to draw conclusions about a much larger group of people. A good example of this is provided by the opinion poll. A poll is taken of a few thousand people. From the information that these people provide, remarkably accurate conclusions can be drawn that refer to the whole population, which is many times greater in number. Collecting information from a small group to draw conclusions about a large group is know as inferential statistics.

## Section 10.1 Types of data

When we observe, count or measure something, we end up with a collection of numbers. These numbers are called data. Data is the plural of datum which means a piece of information.

## 1. Numerical data

Data which can be counted or measured is called numerical data because the answer is a number. Numerical data can be either discrete or continuous.

## Discrete data

Data which can take only certain individual values is called discrete data.
Here are some examples of discrete data:
> The number of goals scored by football teams on a Saturday
> The number of desks in the classrooms of the school
> The marks achieved in a test

## Continuous data

Continuous data is measured on some scale and can take any value on that scale. Here are some examples of continuous data:
> The heights of students in your class
> The speed of cars passing a certain point on a road
> The time taken to complete a 100-metre sprint

## Example 1

For each of these types of data, write down whether it is discrete or continuous.
(i) the number of coins in your pocket
(ii) the number of tickets sold for a concert
(iii) the time taken to complete a puzzle
(iv) the weights of students in your class
(v) dress sizes
(i) discrete
(ii) discrete
(iii) continuous
(iv) continuous
(v) discrete

## 2. Categorical data

The answer to the question, 'What colour is your car?' will not be a numerical value.
Rather, it will fit into a group or category such as blue, red, black, white, ...
Data which fits into a group or category is called categorical data.
Here are some examples of categorical data:
> gender (male, female)
> country of birth (Ireland, France, Spain, Nigeria ...)
> favourite sport (soccer, hurling, tennis, basketball ...)
The three examples of data above are generally referred to as nominal categorical data.
Categorical data in which the categories have an obvious order such as first division, second division, third division, etc, is called ordinal data.

Other examples of ordinal data are:
> type of house (1-bedroomed, 2-bedroomed, 3-bedroomed)
> attendance at football matches (never, sometimes, very often)
> opinion scales (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree).
The data you collect can be divided into two broad categories, namely, primary data and secondary data.

## 3. Primary data

Data that is collected by an organisation or an individual who is going to use it is called primary data.

Primary data is generally obtained
> by using a questionnaire
> by carrying out an expeirment
> by investigations
> by making observations and recording the results.

## 4. Secondary data

Data which is already available, or has been collected by somebody else for a different purpose, is called secondary data.

Secondary data is obtained
> from the internet, e.g., the National Census
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-370.jpg?height=228&width=423&top_left_y=1720&top_left_x=1208)
> from published statistics and databases
> from tables and charts in newspapers and magazines.

## 5. Univariate data

When one item of information is collected, for example, from each member of a group of people, the data collected is called univariate data.

Examples of univariate data include:
> colour of eyes
> distance from school
> height in centimetres.

## 6. Bivariate data

Data that contains two items of information, such as the height and weight of a person, is generally called paired data or bivariate data.

Examples of bivariate data are:
> hours of study per week and marks scored in an examination
> the age of a car and the price of that car
> the engine sizes of cars and the number of kilometres travelled on a litre of petrol.
Colour of hair and gender is an example of bivariate categorical data.
The number of rooms in a house and the number of children in the house is an example of bivariate discrete data.

## Example 2

For each of these sets of data, write down whether it is numerical or categorical:
(i) the sizes of shoes sold in a shop
(ii) the colours of socks sold in a shop
(iii) the subjects offered to Leaving Certificate students
(iv) the marks given by judges in a debating competition
(v) the crops grown on a village farm
(vi) the area of your classroom.

## Section 10.2 Collecting data

Data is collected for a variety of reasons and from a variety of sources.
Companies do market research to find out what customers like or dislike about their products and to see whether or not they would like new products. The government carries out a census of every person in the country every five years. Local government, education authorities and other organisations use the information obtained for further planning.
Data can be collected through direct observation such as a naturalist observing animal behaviour. In an observational study, the observer wishes to record data without interfering with the process being observed.

Apart from observational studies, data may also be collected by
> carrying out a survey
> doing an experiment
> conducting interviews or completing questionnaires
> using a data logger which records data or readings over a period of time, using a sensor.

## 1. Surveys

Surveys are particularly useful for collecting data that is likely to be personal.
The main survey methods are:
> postal surveys in which people are asked questions
> personal interviews in which people are asked questions; this type of survey is very widely-used in market research
> telephone surveys; here the interview is conducted by phone
> observation, which involves monitoring behaviour or information.

| Survey method | Advantages | Disadvantages |

## 2. Questionnaires

One of the most commonly-used methods of conducting a survey is by means of a questionnaire.

A questionnaire is a set of questions designed to obtain data from individuals.
People who answer questionnaires are called respondents.
There are two ways in which the questions can be asked.
> An interviewer asks the questions and fills in the questionnaire.
> People are given a questionnaire and asked to fill in the responses themselves.
When you are writing questions for a questionnaire,
> be clear on what you want to find out and what data you need
> ask short, concise questions
> start with simple questions to encourage the person who is giving the responses
> provide response boxes where possible: $\quad$ Yes $\square \quad$ No $\square$
> avoid leading questions such as
'Don't you agree that there is too much sport on television?'
or 'Do you think that professional footballers are overpaid?'
> avoid personal questions such as,
'Do you live in an affluent area?'
or 'Are you well educated?'
or 'Are you overweight?'
A choice of responses can be very useful in replying to the question, 'What age are you?'
Here is an example: Tick your age in one of the boxes below:

Under 18 years
18-30
$\square$
31-50
$\square$
Over 50

Notice that there are no gaps in the ages and that only one response applies to each person.
When you are collecting data, you need to make sure that your survey or experiment is fair and avoids bias. If bias exists, the data collected might be unrepresentative.

The boxes given below contain questions that should be avoided because they either are too vague, too personal, or may influence the answer.

How often do you play tennis?
Sometimes $\square \quad$ Occasionally $\square \quad$ Often $\square$

The three words sometimes, occasionally and often mean different things to different people.

Normal people enjoy swimming.
Do you enjoy swimming?
Yes $\square \quad$ No $\square$

This is a leading question and may cause the result to be biased.
The first sentence should not be there.

Have you ever stolen goods from a supermarket?
Yes $\square \quad$ No $\square$

Few people are likely to answer this question honestly if they have already stolen.

Whenever you undertake a survey or experiment, it is advisable to do a pilot survey. A pilot survey is one that is carried out on a very small scale to make sure the design and methods of the survey are likely to produce the information required. It should identify any problems with the wording of the questions and likely responses.

## 3. Designed experiments

In statistics, the word 'experiment' generally refers to a situation where the experimentor carries out some activity and records the results by counting or measuring or simply observing.

Thus an experiment may consist of
> tossing three coins and recording the number of times two heads show
> measuring the circumference of oak trees in a wood
> throwing a dice several times to determine if it is biased
> recording the side-effects of a new drug
> investigating whether people are better at remembering words, numbers or pictures.

## 4. Control group

If we wish to investigate whether a new drug has any effect on those who take it, we select a group of patients, chosen at random, to form a sample. The sample is then divided randomly into two groups. Both groups think that they are taking the new drug, but only the first group actually take it.

The second group are given an inactive substance (or placebo) but they think they have taken the drug. This second group is called a control group. If more patients get better in the first group, then the drug has an effect.

## Explanatory and response variables

In a statistical experiment, one of the variables will be controlled while its effect on the other variable is observed.

The controlled variable is called the explanatory variable.
The effect being observed is called the response variable.

## Example 1

A research team is investigating whether the adding of fish oil to the daily diet of school students increases their IQ. A school of 500 students is selected. Two groups, each of 50 students, are selected at random.
Group A is given a daily ration of fish oil.
Group B is given the same food as Group A, but no fish oil.
(i) Which group is the control group?
(ii) What is the explanatory variable in this experiment?
(iii) What is the response variable?
(i) Group B is the control group.
(ii) The explanatory variable is the fish oil; that is, the variable whose effect on the response variable we wish to study.
(iii) The response variable is the IQ of the student; that is, the variable whose changes we wish to study.

## Section 10.3 Populations and sampling

In a statistical enquiry, you often need information about a particular group. This group is known as the population and it could be small, large or even infinite.

Examples of populations include
(i) all second-level pupils in Ireland
(ii) paid-up members of golf clubs
(iii) people entitled to vote in a general election.

If information is obtained from all members of a population, the survey is called a census.

## Sample survey

When a population is large, taking a census can be very time-consuming and difficult to do with accuracy. So when a census is ruled out as being impractical, information is normally taken from a small part of the population. The chosen members of the population are called a sample and an investigation using a sample is called a sample survey. Data from a sample can be obtained relatively cheaply and quickly. If the data is representative of the population, a sample survey can give an accurate indication of the population characteristic that is being studied.

The size of a sample is important. If the sample is too small, the results may not be very reliable.
If the sample is too large, the data may take a long time to collect and analyse.
However, large samples are more likely to give reliable information than small ones.

## Bias in sampling

The sample you select for your study is very important. If the sample is not properly selected, the results may be biased. If bias exists, the results will be distorted and so may not be representative of the population as a whole.

Bias in a sample may arise from any of the following:
> Choosing a sample which is not representative
Example Cara is doing a survey on people's attitude towards gambling. If she stands outside a casino and questions people as they enter or leave, the results will be biased as these people are already involved in gambling.
> Not identifying the correct population
Example The school principal wants to find out about students' attitudes to school uniforms. She questions ten Leaving Certificate students only. This may lead to biased results as the opinions of the younger students (from 1st year to 5th year) are not included.
> Failure to respond to a survey
Many people do not fill in responses to questionnaires sent through the post. Those who do respond may not be representative of the population being surveyed.
> Dishonest answers to questions

## Sampling methods

The purpose of sampling is to gain information about the whole population by selecting a sample from that population. If you want the sample to be representative of the population, you must give every member of the population an equal chance of being included in the sample. This is known as random sampling. Before a random sample is selected, a sampling frame must be used to identify the population. A sampling frame consists of all the items in the population to ensure that every item has a chance of being selected in the sample.

Some of the most commonly-used sampling methods are given below.

## 1. Simple random sampling

A sample of size $n$ is called a simple random sample if every possible sample of size $n$ has an equal chance of being selected. In practice, this means that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.

There are many ways of doing this.
Methods for choosing a simple random sample could involve giving each member of the population a number and then selecting the numbers for the sample in one of these ways:
> putting the numbers into a hat and then selecting however many you need for the sample
> using a random number table
> using a random number generator on your calculator or computer
Any of these methods are suitable only if the population is relatively small and the sampling frame is clearly identified.

## 2. Stratified sampling

Most populations contain identifiable strata. For example male / female or Retired / working / in education etc.

| $<40 \mathrm{yrs}$ | $40-60 \mathrm{yrs}$ | $>60 \mathrm{yrs}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $45 \%$ | $40 \%$ | $15 \%$ |

Assume this table reflected the age distribution of a particular country. If samples are being used to determine preferences in music or film or technological innovation in this county and if the sample (randomly selected) contain proportions (of age) which do not reflect their proportion in the population then there will obviously be an inbuilt bias and a misleading view of the population.
Stratified sampling is used when the population can be split into separate groups or strata that are quite different from each other. The number selected from each group is proportional to the size of the group. Separate random samples are then taken from each group.

## Example 1

A survey to estimate the number of vegetarians in a mixed college with 660 boys and 540 girls is carried out.
A sample of 40 students is required.
How many boys and girls should be included?
The total number of students is $660+540=1200$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Boys: } \frac{660}{1200} \times \frac{40}{1}=22 \text { boys } \\
& \text { Girls: } \frac{540}{1200} \times \frac{40}{1}=18 \text { girls }
\end{aligned}
$$

So 22 boys and 18 girls should be chosen.

## 3. Systematic sampling

A sample which is obtained by choosing items at regular intervals from an unordered list is called a systematic sample. For example, if you wish to choose 20 students from 200 students, you could take every tenth student from the register. Select a random number between 1 and 10, e.g., 4. Thus you could select the 4th, 14th, 24th, 34th ... until you get 20 students

## 4. Quota sampling

Quota sampling is widely used in market research and in opinion polls. First the population is divided into groups in terms of age, general education levels, social class, etc. The interviewer is then told how many people (the quota) to interview in each of these groups, but the interviewer makes the choice of who exactly is asked. A disadvantage of quota sampling is that the actual people or items chosen are left to the discretion of the interviewer which could lead to bias. An advantage of quota sampling is that no sampling frame is required.

## 5. Cluster sampling

If the population is geographically widely spread, simple random sampling would be very difficult and very expensive. In this case the population is divided into clusters (regions). The smaller the cluster the better.

A possible procedure is then:
(i) Select a cluster (region) at random
(ii) Select every member of the cluster or a random sample of members in each Cluster.

Opinion polls generally use cluster sampling.

## 6. Convenience sampling

Convenience sampling involves selecting a group of people because it is easy for us to contact them and they are willing to answer our questions. For example, a sample of 40 students in a school could be selected by simply taking the first 40 names on the school register. Convenience sampling is very quick and easy to organise but it can lead to high levels of bias and so is very likely to be unrepresentative.

## Example 2

Simon wanted to investigate whether people in Ireland measured their height in metric or imperial units. He went to his local supermarket and asked the first twenty people he met how tall they were.
(i) For this survey, state the sampling frame, the sampling method used and why it might be biased.
(ii) Outline a better method of choosing a sample.
(i) The sampling frame could be the whole population of Ireland.

The sampling method used is convenience sampling.
It may be biased as everyone chosen most likely lives in the same area and so may not provide a cross-section of social class and age-groups. Also, the sample is too small.
(ii) A better method would be to use stratified sampling. In this way, you could ensure that men and women across all age-groups, different ethnic groups and different social classes were represented in the sample.

## Section 10.4 Measures of location

When we are presented with a huge mass of numbers (data), we need just one or two numbers that would convey most of the essential information. These numbers are generally referred to as summary statistics.

There are two main types of summary statistic, namely, measures of location and measures of spread. Measures of location answer the question 'What value is typical of the values in the data?' Measures of spread answer the questions 'How much do the values vary?' or 'How spread out are the values?'

In this section, we will deal with measures of location or averages.
There are three different types of average in statistics.
These are the mode, the mean and the median.

## 1. The Mode

The mode is the most common value in a set of data. The mode is very useful when one value appears much more often than any other. It is easy to find and can be used for non-numerical data such as the colours of cars sold by a car dealership.

The following numbers represent the ages of students on a school bus.

$$
10,11,12,12,12,13,13,14,14,15,15,15,15,16,16,16,17,17
$$

The number in this list with the greatest frequency is 15 .
$\therefore$ the mode $=15$ years.

## 2. The Mean

To find the mean of a set of numbers,

1. Find the sum of all the numbers.
2. Divide this sum by the number of numbers.

The mean is the most frequently-used 'average'.
It is important because it considers every piece of The mean is $=\frac{\text { sum of the numbers }}{\text { number of numbers }}$ data. However, it can be affected by extreme values.
The mean of the numbers $12,14,10,17,21$ and 22 is:

$$
\text { Mean }=\frac{12+14+10+17+21+22}{6}=\frac{96}{6}=16
$$

## The mean of a frequency distribution

The table below shows the marks (from 1 to 10) scored by the twenty pupils in a class.

| Marks | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| No. of pupils | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |

The average or mean mark of this distribution is found by dividing the total number of marks by the total number of pupils.

To find the total number of marks, we multiply each mark (or variable) by the number of pupils (frequency) who received that mark.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad \text { the mean } & =\frac{1(1)+2(1)+3(1)+4(3)+5(5)+6(3)+7(2)+8(2)+9(1)+10(1)}{1+1+1+3+5+3+2+2+1+1} \\
& =\frac{110}{20}=5.5 \text { marks }
\end{aligned}
$$

If $x$ stands for the variable and $f$ stands for the frequency, then

$$
\text { Mean }=\frac{\Sigma f x}{\Sigma f}
$$

$$
\text { mean }=\frac{\Sigma f x}{\Sigma f}
$$

where $\Sigma f x$ is the sum of all the variables multiplied by the corresponding frequencies and $\Sigma f$ is the sum of the frequencies.

## Grouped frequency distributions

The grouped frequency distribution table below shows the marks (out of 25 ) achieved by fifty students in a test.

| Marks achieved | $1-5$ | $6-10$ | $11-15$ | $16-20$ | $21-25$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| No. of students | 11 | 12 | 15 | 9 | 3 |

While it is not possible to find the exact mean of a grouped frequency distribution, we can find an estimate of the mean by taking the mid-interval value of each class.
The mid-interval value in the (1-5) class is found by adding 1 and 5 and dividing by 2 , i.e., $\frac{1+5}{2}=3$

Similarly, the mid-interval value of the $(6-10)$ class is $\frac{6+10}{2}=8$.
The table given on the previous page is reproduced, with the mid-interval values written in smaller size over each class interval.

|  | 3 | 8 | 13 | 18 | 23 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Marks achieved | $1-5$ | $6-10$ | $11-15$ | $16-20$ | $21-25$ |
| No. of students | 11 | 12 | 15 | 9 | 3 |

$$
\text { Mean }=\frac{\Sigma f x}{\Sigma f}=\frac{11(3)+12(8)+15(13)+9(18)+3(23)}{11+12+15+9+3}=\frac{555}{50}=11.1
$$

## 3. The Median

To find the median of a list of numbers, put the numbers in order of size, starting with the smallest. The median is the middle number.
If there are 11 numbers in the list, the middle value is $\frac{1}{2}(11+1)$, i.e., the 6 th value.
If there are 10 numbers in the list, the middle number is $\frac{1}{2}(10+1)$, i.e., the $5 \frac{1}{2}$ th value.
This value is half the sum of the 5 th and 6 th values.

If there are $n$ numbers in a list, the middle value is $\frac{1}{2}(n+1)$.
If $\frac{1}{2}(n+1)=4$, then the 4th value is the median.

## Example 1

Find the median of these numbers: $5,8,12,4,9,3,7,2$.
Writing the numbers in order of size, we get:

$$
2,3,4,5,7,8,9,12
$$

Write the numbers in order of size to find the median.

The median is $\frac{1}{2}(5+7)=\frac{5+7}{2}=\frac{12}{2}=6$
$\therefore \quad$ the median $=6$

## The mode and median of a frequency distribution

The frequency table below shows the number of letters in the answers to a crossword.

| No. of letters in word | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Frequency | 3 | 4 | 9 | 5 | 2 |

The mode is the number of letters (in the word) that occurs most frequently. Thus the mode is 5 as it occurs more often than any other number.

The median is the middle number in the distribution.
The total frequency is $3+4+9+5+2$, i.e., 23 .
The middle value of the 23 values is $\frac{1}{2}(23+1)$, i.e., the 12 th value.
We take the frequency row and find the column that contains the 12th number.
The sum of the first two frequencies is $3+4=7$.
The sum of the first three frequencies is $3+4+9=16$.
Thus the 12th value occurs in the third column, where the number of letters in the word is 5 .
$\therefore \quad$ the median $=5$
When dealing with grouped frequency distributions, we use the same procedure to find the class interval in which the median lies.

## Deciding which average to use

The three averages, the mean, the mode and the median, are all useful but one may be more appropriate than the others in different situations.

The mode is useful when you want to know, for example, which shoe size is the most common.
The mean is useful for finding a 'typical' value when most of the data is closely grouped. The mean may not give a typical value if the data is very spread out or if it includes a few values that are very different from the rest. These values are known as outliers.
Take, for example, a small company where the chief executive earns $€ 12100$ a month and the other eleven employees each earn $€ 2500$ a month.
Here the mean monthly salary is $€ 3300$ which is not typical of the monthly salaries.
In situations like this, the median or middle value may be more typical.
The table below, which compares the advantages and disadvantages of each type of average, should help you make the correct decision.

| Average | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mode | > Easy to find <br> > Not influenced by extreme values | > May not exist <br> > Not very useful for further analysis |
| Median | > Unaffected by extremes <br> > Easy to calculate if data is ordered | > Not always a given data value <br> > Not very useful for further analysis |
| Mean | > Uses all the data <br> > Easy to calculate <br> > Very useful for further analysis | > Distorted by extreme results <br> > Mean is not always a given data value |

## Example 2

There are 10 apartments in a block.
On a particular day, the number of letters delivered to each of the apartments is

$$
2,0,5,3,4,0,1,0,3,15
$$

Calculate the mean, mode and median number of letters.
Which of these averages is the most suitable to represent this data?
Give a reason for your answer.
Mean $=\frac{2+0+5+3+4+0+1+0+3+15}{10}=\frac{33}{10}=3.3$
Mode $=0$
Median: $0,0,0,1,2,3,3,4,5,15$

$$
\text { Median }=\frac{2+3}{2}=\frac{5}{2}=2 \frac{1}{2}
$$

Here the mean has been distorted by the large number of letters delivered to one apartment. It is, therefore, not a good measure of the 'typical' number of letters delivered.
Neither is the mode a good measure of the 'typical' number of letters, since seven out of ten apartments do receive some letters.
The median is the best measure of the 'typical' number of letters delivered since half of the apartments receive more than the median and half receive less than the median.

## Outliers

An outlier is a very high or very low value that is not typical of the other values in a data set. If the data set is small, an outlier can have a significant effect on the mean.

## Exercise 10.4

1. Rewrite each of the following arrays of numbers in order of size and then write down

## Section 10.5 Measures of variability

When dealing with averages in the previous section, we were looking for a data value that was typical or representative of all the data values.

In this section, we will discuss the measure of the spread of the data about the mean to help us describe the data more fully.

The three most common ways of measuring the spread or variability of data are the range, the interquartile range and standard deviation.

## 1. The range

The range of a set of data is the highest value of the set minus the lowest value.

It shows the spread of the data.
It is very useful when comparing two sets of data.
The range is a crude measure of spread because it uses only the largest and smallest value of the data.
The range of the numbers $14,18,11,27,21,19,33,24$ is

$$
\text { Range }=33-11=22
$$

## 2. Quartiles and Interquartile range

The range of a set of data is the largest value minus the smallest value.

When data is arranged in order of size, we have already learned that the median is the value halfway into the data. So we can say that the median divides the data into two halves. The data can also be divided into four quarters.

When the data is arranged in ascending order of size:
> the lower quartile is the value one quarter of the way into the data
> the upper quartile is the value three quarters of the way into the data
$>$ the upper quartile minus the lower quartile is called the interquartile range.
The lower quartile is written $\boldsymbol{Q}_{1}$; the median is $\boldsymbol{Q}_{2}$; the upper quartile is $\boldsymbol{Q}_{3}$.
Consider the following data which is arranged in order of size. It contains 15 numbers.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-391.jpg?height=366&width=1359&top_left_y=180&top_left_x=216)

The lower quartile $Q_{1}=5$.
The median $Q_{2}=12$.
The upper quartile $Q_{3}=14$.
The interquartile range $=Q_{3}-Q_{1}=14-5=9$.
When $n$ data values are written in order:
$>$ the lower quartile, $Q_{1}$, is the $\frac{1}{4}(n+1)$ th value
$>$ the median, $Q_{2}$, is the $\frac{1}{2}(n+1)$ th value
$>$ the upper quartile, $Q_{3}$, is the $\frac{3}{4}(n+1)$ th value.
If you get a non-integer value for $\frac{1}{4}(n+1)$ or $\frac{3}{4}(n+1)$, e.g., $3 \frac{3}{4}$, find the mean of the 3rd and 4th pieces of data.
If you get a non-integer for $\frac{1}{2}(n+1)$, take the mean of the two data values on either side.
For example if $\frac{1}{2}(n+1)=3 \frac{1}{2}$, find the mean of the 3rd and 4th data values.

## Example 1

These are the test marks of 11 students:

$$
52,78,61,49,79,47,54,58,72,62,73
$$

Find
(i) the median
(ii) the lower quartile
(iii) the upper quartile
(iv) the interquartile range.

We first rewrite the numbers in order, starting with the smallest:

$$
47,49,52,54,58,61,62,72,73,78,79
$$

(i) The median is the middle value of the list.

Since there are 11 values, the middle value is $\frac{1}{2}(11+1)$ i.e. the 6th value.
The 6th value is $61 \Rightarrow$ the median $=61$.
(ii) The lower quartile is the value that is $\frac{1}{4}$ way through the distribution.

This value is found by getting $\frac{1}{4}(11+1)=$ the 3rd value.
The 3rd value is $52 \Rightarrow$ the lower quartile $\left(Q_{1}\right)=52$.
(iii) The upper quartile is the value that is $\frac{3}{4}$ way through the distribution.

This value is found by getting $\frac{3}{4}(11+1)=$ the 9 th value.
This ninth value is $73 \Rightarrow$ the upper quartile $\left(Q_{3}\right)=73$.
(iv) The interquartile range $=Q_{3}-Q_{1}$

$$
=73-52=21
$$

## 3. Standard deviation

One of the most important and frequently-used measures of spread is called standard deviation. It shows how much variation there is from the average (mean). It may be thought of as the average difference of the scores from the mean, that is, how far they are away from the mean. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean; a high standard deviation indicates that the data is spread out over a large range of values.

The Greek letter $\sigma$ is used to denote standard deviation.

Take, for example, all adult men in Ireland. The average height is about 177 cm with a standard deviation of about 8 cm .

For this large population, about $68 \%$ of the men have a height within 8 cm of the mean.

If the mean is $\bar{x}$ and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of a large sample, then $68 \%$ will lie between $\bar{x}+\sigma$ and $\bar{x}-\sigma$

## Procedure for finding the standard deviation

The steps used to find the standard deviation of a set of numbers are as follows:

1. Calculate the mean of the numbers. This is written $\bar{x}$.
2. Find the deviation (or difference) of each variable, $x$, from the mean. This is denoted by $(x-\bar{x})$.
3. Square each of these deviations, i.e., find $(x-\bar{x})^{2}$.
4. Find the sum $(\Sigma)$ of these values, i.e., find $\Sigma(x-\bar{x})^{2}$.
5. Divide this result by $n$, the number of numbers.

This gives $\frac{\Sigma(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{n}$.
6. Finally, get the square root of the result in $\mathbf{5}$.

There is no need to use this formula if you can remember the steps listed above.
Alternatively, you may use a calculator.

$$
\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{n}}
$$

## Example 2

Find the standard deviation of the numbers $6,9,10,12,13$.
The mean $=\frac{6+9+10+12+13}{5}=\frac{50}{5}=10$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma & =\sqrt{\frac{(6-10)^{2}+(9-10)^{2}+(10-10)^{2}+(12-10)^{2}+(13-10)^{2}}{5}} \\
& =\sqrt{\frac{(-4)^{2}+(-1)^{2}+(0)^{2}+(2)^{2}+(3)^{2}}{5}} \\
& =\sqrt{\frac{16+1+0+4+9}{5}}=\sqrt{\frac{30}{5}}=\sqrt{6}=2.45
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore$ the standard deviation is 2.45

## Finding the Standard Deviation of a Frequency Distribution

When finding the standard deviation from a frequency distribution, the deviation of each variable from the mean is squared and then multiplied by the frequency ( $f$ ) of that variable. The result is then divided by the sum of the frequencies.

Finally, we get the square root of the result.
This procedure can be represented by the formula

$$
\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma f(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{\Sigma f}}
$$

where $\Sigma f(x-\bar{x})^{2}$ is the sum of the $f(x-\bar{x})^{2}$ column and $\Sigma f$ is the sum of the frequencies.

The worked example below will show you how to lay out your work when finding the standard deviation of a frequency distribution.

## Example 3

Find the standard deviation of the following frequency distribution:

| Variable ( $\boldsymbol{x}$ ) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Frequency ( $\boldsymbol{f}$ ) | 9 | 9 | 6 | 4 | 7 | 3 |

First find the mean of the distribution.
The mean $=\frac{(9 \times 1)+(9 \times 2)+(6 \times 3)+(4 \times 4)+(7 \times 5)+(3 \times 6)}{9+9+6+4+7+3}$

$$
\Rightarrow \quad \bar{x}=\frac{114}{38}=3
$$

Now set out a table like this.

| $\boldsymbol{x}$ | $f$ | $\boldsymbol{x}-\overline{\boldsymbol{x}}$ | $(\boldsymbol{x}-\overline{\boldsymbol{x}})^{\mathbf{2}}$ | $f(x-\bar{x})^{2}$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 9 | -2 | 4 | 36 |
| 2 | 9 | -1 | 1 | 9 |
| 3 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 4 |
| 5 | 7 | 2 | 4 | 28 |
| 6 | 3 | 3 | 9 | 27 |

$\downarrow$
$\Sigma f=38$

$$
\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma f(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{\Sigma f}}=\sqrt{\frac{104}{38}}=1.65
$$

Note: To calculate the standard deviation of a grouped frequency distribution, take the mid-interval values of the variables and proceed as in Example 3 above.

## Use of calculator to find standard deviation

The tedious work involved in calculating the standard deviation of a large set of data can be substantially reduced by using a scientific calculator.

In the following examples, we will use the Casio fx-83ES calculator to illustrate the keys and steps involved in finding standard deviation.

## Example 4

Find (a) the mean (b) the standard deviation of the following set of numbers:
(i) $5,3,1,8,2$
(ii) $10,6,2,16,4$
(i) Key in MODE and select 2 for statistics mode.

| Then select 1 for 1 - VAR. |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Now input the numbers 5 | $=$ |
| 3 | $=$ |
| 2 | $=$ |
|  | 2 |


| CASIO |  | $A$ - $83 E S$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  | $\times$ | $F_{R E Q}$ |
| 1 | 5 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | 1 |
| 4 | 8 | 1 |
| 5 | 2 | 1 |

To get your answers, key in AC to clear, and SHIFT 1 to go to menu.
Now select 5 to get statistics on variables.
Then select 2 for $\bar{x}$ (the mean), then $=$
The mean $\bar{x}$ is 3.8.
To proceed to get the standard deviation, key in AC to clear.
Now key in SHIFT 1 to go to menu and select 5 to get statistics on variables.
Now key in 3 for $x \sigma n$ (standard deviation) $=$
The result is $2.4819 \ldots=2.5$
$\therefore$ standard deviation $=2.5$
(ii) $10,6,2,16,4$.

Here is the sequence of keys to find the mean and standard deviation.
MODE 21
$10=6=2=16=4=$
AC SHIFT $152=7.6=$ mean
AC SHIFT $153=4.963869 \ldots=5.0=$ standard deviation

## 4. Percentiles

Percentiles divide data into 100 equal parts.
Percentiles give a measure of your position relative to others in a data set. If you are told that you are on the 70th percentile in a competitive test, this means that $70 \%$ of the competitors had scores lower than yours (or $30 \%$ higher than yours). It is important not to confuse percentiles with percentages. For example, you could achieve a score of $70 \%$ in a state examination but you could be at the 80th percentile.

Percentiles are denoted by $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{40} \ldots$

## How to find $\boldsymbol{P}_{\boldsymbol{k}}$ of a data set

When asked to find the 40th percentile, $P_{40}$, we are required to find the value of the number that is $40 \%$ of the way into the data set.

Thus to find $P_{k}$ of a data set:

1. Order the numbers in the data set from smallest to largest.
2. Now find $k \%$ of the total number of data points in the set. i.e. find $\frac{k}{100} \times n$, where $n$ is the number of numbers in the set.
3. (i) If the answer in 2 is a whole number, for example 5 , then the $k$ th percentile is the mean of the 5th and 6th numbers in the data set.
(ii) If the answer in 2 is not a whole number, for example $6 \frac{1}{4}$, round up to 7 . The 7th number in the data set will be the $k$ th percentile.

## Example 5

Here are the marks of 24 students in a science test:

| 48 | 54 | 76 | 34 | 82 | 67 | 76 | 92 | 54 | 72 | 86 | 47 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 80 | 73 | 64 | 57 | 68 | 36 | 82 | 74 | 71 | 62 | 46 | 52 |

(i) Find $P_{60}$
(ii) Find $P_{75}$
(iii) If Sinead scored 74 in the test, find on what percentile is her score.

First we order the data, starting with the smallest:

| 34 | 36 | 46 | 47 | 48 | 52 | 54 | 54 | 57 | 62 | 64 | 67 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 68 | 71 | 72 | 73 | 74 | 76 | 76 | 80 | 82 | 82 | 86 | 92 |

(i) $P_{60}=\frac{60}{100} \times \frac{24}{1}=14.4$

Since 14.4 is not a whole number, we go to the next whole number, i.e. 15 .
$P_{60}=$ the 15 th number in the set.
This number is 72. Thus $P_{60}=72$.
(ii) $P_{75}=\frac{75}{100} \times \frac{24}{1}=18$

As this is a whole number, we find the mean of the 18th and 19th numbers in the data set.

These numbers are 76 and 76.
$\therefore \quad P_{75}=\frac{76+76}{2}=76$
(iii) If Sinead scored 74, this means that 16 students scored lower than she did.

We now find the percentile that corresponds to 16 .
Percentile $=\frac{16}{24} \times \frac{100}{1}=66.66$
Therefore Sinead is in the 67th percentile.

## Example 6

Leah lives near the local bus stop. One day she recorded the number of people waiting in the queue for each bus. The table below shows her data.

| Number of people | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Frequency | 4 | 6 | 3 | 8 | 0 | 7 | 5 | 9 | 8 |

(i) Find $P_{40}$
(ii) Find $P_{82}$
(i) To find $P_{40}$, we find $\frac{40}{100}$ of the total frequency.

The total frequency is 50 .
$P_{40}=\frac{40}{100} \times \frac{50}{1}=20 \Rightarrow P_{40}=\frac{20 \mathrm{th} \text { value }+21 \mathrm{st} \text { value }}{2}$
The 20th and 21st values lie in the fourth column, i.e., 6 people.
$\therefore \quad P_{40}=6$ people
(ii) $P_{82}=\frac{82}{100} \times \frac{50}{1}=41 \Rightarrow P_{82}=\frac{41 \text { st value }+42 \text { nd value }}{2}$

The 41st and 42nd values lie in the eight column, i.e., 10 people.
$\therefore \quad P_{82}=10$ people

## Section 10.6 Stem and leaf diagrams (stemplots)

A stem and leaf diagram is a very useful way of presenting data. It is useful because it shows all the original data and also gives you the overall picture or shape of the distribution.
It is similar to a horizontal bar chart, with the numbers themselves forming the bars.
Stem and leaf diagrams are suitable only for small amounts of data.
Often the stem shows the tens digit of the values and the leaves show the units digit. If you put them together, you get the original value.
For example $4 \mid 2$ represents 42.

A typical stem and leaf diagram is shown below.

| 0 | 6 | 9 |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 2 | 5 | 7 |  |
| 2 | 3 | 3 | 6 | 8 |
| 3 | 0 | 2 | 7 |  |
| 4 | 1 | 2 | 6 |  |
| 5 | 3 |  |  | This represents 1 |

You must always add a key to show how the stem and leaf combine.

The data represented above is:
$6,9,12,15,17,23,23,26,28,30,32,37,41,42,46,53$

## Example 1

Here are the marks gained by a class of students in a science test.

| 58 | 65 | 40 | 59 | 68 | 63 | 81 | 76 | 63 | 57 | 44 | 47 | 53 | 70 | 80 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 68 | 81 | 61 | 57 | 49 | 70 | 54 | 75 | 69 | 65 | 59 | 52 | 63 | 63 | 74 |

(i) Construct a stem and leaf diagram to represent this data.
(ii) What is the mode of the data?
(iii) What is the median?
(iv) What is the range of the data?
(i) First draw the stem of the diagram.

The smallest value in the list is 40 and the largest value is 81 .
The stem of the diagram will be the tens digits from 4 to 8 .
Now work through the data values and put the second digit on the appropriate row.

| 4 | 0 | 4 | 7 | 9 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | 8 | 9 | 7 | 3 | 7 | 4 | 9 | 2 |  |  |
| 6 | 5 | 8 | 3 | 3 | 8 | 1 | 9 | 5 | 3 | 3 |
| 7 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 4 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 8 | 1 | 0 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

For the first value, 58 , the 8 will go on the 5 row.

The numbers on the right of the diagram are the leaves.

Finally, rewrite the diagram with all the leaves in order, with the smallest nearest to the stem.
Remember to include a key.

| 4 | 0 | 4 | 7 | 9 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 5 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 7 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 9 |  |  |
| 6 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 8 | 8 | 9 |
| 7 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 5 | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 8 | 0 | 1 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Key: |

Key: $6 \mid 3=63$
(ii) The mode is 63 as this is the value that occurs most often.
(iii) As there are 30 values, the median will be the mean of the 15th and 16th values.
Count the values in the stem and leaf diagram to find the 15th and 16th values.
Since these are both 63 , the median is 63 .

If there are 30 values, the middle value is $\frac{1}{2}(30+1)$, i.e., $15 \frac{1}{2}$.
This will be half the sum of the 15th and 16th values.
(iv) The range is the highest value minus the lowest value.

$$
=81-40=41
$$

## Different values for the stems

In a stem and leaf diagram, each leaf consists of one digit only. The stem may have more than one digit.
Here are the times, in seconds, for the contestants in a 60 -metre race.
$\begin{array}{llllllllllll}6.6 & 4.9 & 5.7 & 7.6 & 8.2 & 6.3 & 6.5 & 7.4 & 5.1 & 5.3 & 6.2 & 7.8\end{array}$

This time we will use the units as the stems.

Step 1 Draw the first diagram.
The units are the stems.
The tenths are the leaves.

| 4 | 9 |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | 7 | 1 | 3 |  |
| 6 | 6 | 3 | 5 | 2 |
| 7 | 6 | 4 | 8 |  |
| 8 | 2 |  |  |  |

Step 2 Put the leaves in numerical order.

Key: $6 \mid 3=6.3$ seconds

| 4 | 9 |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | 1 | 3 | 7 |  |
| 6 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 4 | 6 | 8 |  |
| 8 | 2 |  |  |  |

## Back-to-back stem and leaf diagrams

Two stem and leaf diagrams can be drawn using the same stem.
These are known as back-to-back stem and leaf diagrams.
The leaves of one set of data are put to the right of the stem.
The leaves of the other set of data are put on the left.
A back-to-back stem and leaf diagram is very useful to compare two sets of data.
Jack and Ciara compared the length of time they spent each evening on their homework.

Their times are shown in this back-to-back stem and leaf diagram.

|  | Jack |  |  |  |  | Ciara |  |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 6 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 2 |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | 8 | 6 | 5 | 3 | 6 | 7 |  |  |
|  |  |  | 3 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 6 | 6 |  |
|  |  |  |  | 1 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  |
| Key: $5 \mid 3=35$ minutes |  | 6 | 4 | 8 |  | Key |  |  |  |

Sometimes the key is given as $5|3| 6$.
This means 35 for Jack and 36 for Ciara.

We read Jack's times from the stem to the left.
Thus Jack's times are:

$$
22,23,25,25,26,35,36, \ldots
$$

Ciara's times are:

$$
36,37,44,46,46,52, \ldots
$$

The following example shows how a back-to-back stem and leaf diagram can be used to compare two sets of data.

## Example 2

Robert and Jane compared the lengths of time they spent each evening watching television.
Their times are shown in the following back-to-back stem and leaf diagram.

| Robert |  |  |  |  |  |  | Jane |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| 7 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 2 |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | 9 | 6 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 6 |  |  |  |
|  |  |  | 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 7 |  |  |
|  |  |  |  | 2 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 4 |  |  |
| 43 minutes |  |  | 6 | 5 | 7 |  |  |  |  |  | Key: $6 \mid 5=65$ minutes

(i) What does the diagram show about the lengths of time Robert and Jane spent watching television?
(ii) What was Jane's median time spent watching television?
(iii) What was Robert's median time?
(iv) Do these median times support your conclusion in (i) above?
(i) By looking at the diagram, we can see that most of Robert's times are between 22 and 39 minutes.
Most of Jane's times are between 45 and 67 minutes.
This shows that Jane spends more time watching television than Robert does.
(ii) For Jane, the value that is halfway through the distribution is 53. Thus her median time spent watching television is 53 minutes.
(iii) Robert's median time is 34 minutes.
(iv) Because Jane's median time is greater than Robert's, it supports the view, expressed in (i) above, that she spends more time than Robert watching television.

## Finding the interquartile range from a stem and leaf diagram

In Section 10.5 of this chapter, we found that the lower quartile is the value in the data that is one quarter way through the distribution. The upper quartile is the value that is three quarters way through the distribution. The difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile is the interquartile range.

We will now show how to find the two quartiles and the interquartile range of a distribution presented as a stem and leaf diagram.

## Example 3

The stem and leaf diagram below shows the marks, out of 50 , obtained in a maths test.

| Marks obtained |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 2 | 8 |  |  |  |
| 2 | 1 | 4 | 7 | 7 | 8 |
| 3 | 1 | 4 | 5 | 7 |  |
| 4 | 1 | 2 | 8 |  |  |
| 5 | 0 |  |  | Key: $2 \mid 1=21$ |  |

Find (i) the median mark
(ii) the lower quartile
(iii) the upper quartile
(iv) the interquartile range.
(i) The median mark is the mark that is halfway through the distribution.

There are 15 data values.
The halfway value is $\frac{1}{2}(15+1)$ i.e. the 8 th value.
Starting at the lowest value, the 8 th value is 31 .
$\therefore \quad$ the median $=31$
(ii) The lower quartile is the value that is one quarter way through the distribution.
This value is $\frac{1}{4}(15+1)$ i.e. the 4 th value
This value is 24 .
$\therefore \quad$ the lower quartile $=24$
(iii) The upper quartile is the value that is three quarters of the way through the distribution.
This value is $\frac{3}{4}(15+1)$ i.e. the 12 th value.
This value is 41 .
$\therefore \quad$ the upper quartile $=41$
(iv) The interquartile range $=$ upper quartile minus lower quartile

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =41-24 \\
& =17
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 10.7 Histograms

One of the most common ways of representing a frequency distribution is by means of a histogram.
Histograms are very similar to bar charts but there are some important differences:
> there are no gaps between the bars in a histogram
> histograms are used to show continuous data
> the data is always grouped; the groups are called classes
> the area of each bar or rectangle represents the frequency.
Histograms may have equal or unequal class intervals.
For our course, we will confine our study to histograms with equal class intervals.
When the class intervals are equal, drawing a histogram is very similar to drawing a bar chart.

## Example 1

The frequency table below shows the times taken by 32 students to solve a problem.

| Time (in secs) | $0-10$ | $10-20$ | $20-30$ | $30-40$ | $40-50$ | $50-60$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| No. of students | 1 | 2 | 8 | 12 | 6 | 3 |

(i) Draw a histogram to represent this data.
(ii) Write down the modal class.
(iii) In which interval does the median lie?

We first draw two axes at right angles to each other.
We plot the variables (time in this case) on the horizontal axis and plot the frequencies (number of students) on the vertical axis.
(i) The histogram is shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-407.jpg?height=716&width=756&top_left_y=1476&top_left_x=539)

It is important to label each axis.
(ii) The modal class is the class with the highest frequency.

This is the (30-40) second class.
$\therefore$ the modal class is $(30-40)$ seconds.
(iii) The median is the value halfway through the distribution.

There are 32 students altogether; so the middle students are the 16th and 17th students.
The sum of the numbers of students in the first three intervals is

$$
1+2+8 \text { i.e. } 11
$$

The 16th and 17th students will lie in the next interval, i.e., (30-40) seconds. Thus the median lies in the (30-40) second interval.

## Note:

If a table of results does not contain equal class-intervals proceed as follows:

| Time (secs) | $0-20$ | $20-30$ | $30-40$ | $40-50$ | $50-60$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| No. of pupils | 6 | 8 | 10 | 6 | 4 |


| Time | $0-10$ | $10-20$ | $20-30$ | $30-40$ | $40-50$ | $50-60$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| No. of pupils | 3 | 3 | 8 | 10 | 6 | 4 |

Two equal intervals are made by halving the frequency of the original interval.

## Section 10.8 The shape of a distribution

In the previous section, we encountered histograms of various shapes.
The diagrams below show four histograms, all with different shapes.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-410.jpg?height=253&width=296&top_left_y=371&top_left_x=201)

D

Only histogram D appears balanced or symmetrical as it has an axis of symmetry. The other three histograms are less balanced or skewed in some way.
Histograms are very useful when you want to see where the data lies and so get a clear picture of the shape of the distribution. For example, in histogram A above, we can see that most of the data is concentrated at the lower values. In histogram C, the data is concentrated at the higher values. There are some shapes that occur frequently in distributions and you should be able to recognize and name them. The most common and frequently occurring shapes follow.

## 1. Symmetrical distributions

> This distribution has an axis of symmetry down the middle.
It is called a symmetrical (or bell-shaped) distribution.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-410.jpg?height=397&width=479&top_left_y=1284&top_left_x=423)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-410.jpg?height=405&width=479&top_left_y=1311&top_left_x=939)

Mean $=$ Median $=$ Mode
> One of the most important symmetrical distributions in statistics is the normal distribution.
> Real-life examples of a symmetrical (or normal) distribution are
(i) the heights of a random sample of people
(ii) the intelligence quotients (IQ) of a population.

## 2. Positive skew

> When a distribution has most of the data at the lower values, we say it has a positive skew. The following histogram shows a positive skew as most of the data, represented by the higher bars, is mainly to the left.

If there is a positive skew, most of the data is to the left.

Notice that there is a long tail to the right of the distribution.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-411.jpg?height=413&width=571&top_left_y=477&top_left_x=311)
> Real-life examples of a distribution with a positive skew are
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-411.jpg?height=506&width=703&top_left_y=473&top_left_x=945)
(i) the number of children in a family
(ii) the age at which people first learn to ride a bicycle
(iii) the age at which people marry.

## 3. Negative skew

> When a distribution has most of the data at the higher values, we say that the distribution has a negative skew.
When a distribution has a negative skew, the tail will be to the left.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-411.jpg?height=371&width=564&top_left_y=1408&top_left_x=312)

Tail to the left

In a distribution with a positive skew, the tail is to the right; with a negative skew, the tail is to the left.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-411.jpg?height=496&width=564&top_left_y=1416&top_left_x=944)

Mean < Median < Mode
> Real-life examples of a distribution with a negative skew are
(i) the ages at which people have to get their first pair of reading glasses
(ii) the heights of players playing in a professional basketball league.

## 4. Uniform distributions

In a uniform distribution, the data is evenly spread throughout. It does not have a modal class.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-412.jpg?height=168&width=423&top_left_y=166&top_left_x=1208)

## 5. Bimodal distributions

This distribution has two modes.
It is called a bimodal distribution.
The modes are 6 and 16.
A distribution that has three or more modes is said to be multimodal.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-412.jpg?height=439&width=534&top_left_y=370&top_left_x=1098)

## 6. Distributions and standard deviation

Consider the two distributions, (A) and (B), shown below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-412.jpg?height=421&width=517&top_left_y=907&top_left_x=359)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-412.jpg?height=425&width=522&top_left_y=907&top_left_x=960)

In distribution (A), most of the data lies between 2 and 5.
In distribution (B), the data is more spread out and further from the mean than the data in distribution (A).

The more spread out the data is in a distribution, the greater the standard deviation will be.
In the distributions above, we can conclude that (B) has a higher standard deviation than (A). In the two distributions (C) and (D) below, the mean $\mu$ is given in each.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-412.jpg?height=414&width=423&top_left_y=1726&top_left_x=444)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-412.jpg?height=416&width=428&top_left_y=1725&top_left_x=965)

From the diagrams, we can see that more of the data is further from the mean in (C) than in (D). Thus distribution (C) has the greater standard deviation.

6. Some students are using a database of earthquakes to investigate the times between the occurrences of serious earthquakes around the world. They extract information about all of the earthquakes in the 20th century that caused at least 1000 deaths. There are 115 of these.
The students wonder whether there are patterns in the timing of these earthquakes, so they look at the number of days between each successive pair of earthquakes.
They make the following table, showing the number of earthquakes for which the time interval from the previous earthquake is as shown.

| Time in <br> days from <br> previous <br> earthquake | $0-$ <br> 100 | $100-$ <br> 200 | $200-$ <br> 300 | $300-$ <br> 400 | $400-$ <br> 500 | $500-$ <br> 600 | $600-$ <br> 700 | $700-$ <br> 800 | $800-$ <br> 1000 | $1000-$ <br> 1300 |

[Source: National geophysical data center, significant earthquake database: www.ngdc.noaa.gov]
(i) Create a suitable graphical representation of the distribution.
(ii) Describe the distribution. Your description should refer to the shape of the distribution and should include an estimate of the median.
(iii) The mean time between these earthquakes is 309 days and the standard deviation is 277 days. Suppose that such an earthquake has just occurred and that we want to find the probability that the time to the next one will be between 100 and 200 days. Explain why it would not be correct to use standard normal distribution tables ( $z$-tables) to do this.
(iv) Based on the information presented in this question so far, what is the best estimate for the probability described in part (iii) above? Explain your reasoning.
(v) As stated at the beginning, the students chose to analyse earthquake timings by looking at the time intervals between the occurrences of a particular type of earthquake. Suggest a different way that they could have looked at the data in the database in order to try to find patterns in the timing of earthquakes.

## Section 11.1 The equation of a circle with centre $(0,0)$

## Definition

A circle is a set of points equidistant from a given point called the centre.
$[\mathrm{OP}]$ is always equal in length to the radius.
The circle on the right has centre $(0,0)$ and radius $r$.

Let $\mathrm{P}(x, y)$ be any point on the circle.
In the given right-angled triangle we have,

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}
$$

This is the equation of the circle with centre $(0,0)$ and radius $r$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-424.jpg?height=411&width=430&top_left_y=1152&top_left_x=801)

To find the equation of a circle, we require
(i) the centre of the circle
(ii) the length of the radius.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-424.jpg?height=357&width=409&top_left_y=967&top_left_x=1224)

The equation of the circle with centre $(0,0)$ and radius $r$ is

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}
$$

## Example 1

A circle has its centre at $(0,0)$ and passes through the point $(3,-1)$.
(i) Find the length of the radius of the circle.
(ii) Find the equation of the circle.
(i) The length of the radius is the distance from $(0,0)$ to $(3,-1)$. This distance is $\sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}}$

$$
=\sqrt{(3-0)^{2}+(-1-0)^{2}}=\sqrt{9+1}=\sqrt{10}
$$

(ii) Equation of circle: $x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}$

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\Rightarrow & x^{2}+y^{2}=(\sqrt{10})^{2} \\
\Rightarrow & x^{2}+y^{2}=10 \text { is the required equation. }
\end{array}
$$

If we are given the centre and the equation of a tangent to the circle, then the radius is found by getting the length of the perpendicular from the centre of the circle to the tangent.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-425.jpg?height=355&width=361&top_left_y=445&top_left_x=1116)
$d=$ length of radius

## Example 2

The line $2 x+3 y-13=0$ is a tangent to a circle with centre $(0,0)$. Find the equation of this circle.

The radius of the circle is the perpendicular distance from $(0,0)$ to $2 x+3 y-13=0$.

Using the formula $\frac{\left|a x_{1}+b y_{1}+c\right|}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}}$,
the radius $=\frac{|2(0)+3(0)-13|}{\sqrt{4+9}}$

$$
=\frac{13}{\sqrt{13}}=\frac{13 \sqrt{13}}{13}=\sqrt{13}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-425.jpg?height=444&width=541&top_left_y=1079&top_left_x=998)

The equation of the circle is $x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2} \quad r=\sqrt{13}$
i.e. $x^{2}+y^{2}=13$

## Finding the radius of a circle from its equation

The circle whose equation is $x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}$ has centre ( 0,0 ) and radius $=r$.
$\Rightarrow$ the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=8$ has centre $(0,0)$ and radius $\sqrt{8}$.
If the equation of the circle is $4 x^{2}+4 y^{2}=9$, then divide each term by 4 so that the equation is in the form $x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
4 x^{2}+4 y^{2}=9 & \Rightarrow & x^{2}+y^{2} & =\frac{9}{4} \\
& \Rightarrow & r^{2} & =\frac{9}{4} \\
& \Rightarrow & r & =\frac{3}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 11.2 Equations of a circle with centres not at $(0,0)$

## 1. The equation of a circle with centre ( $h, k$ ) and radius $r$

The diagram on the right shows a circle with centre $\mathrm{C}(h, k)$ and radius $r$.
Let $\mathrm{P}(x, y)$ be any point on the circle.
The distance from C to P is equal to the radius.
From the diagram,

$$
|\mathrm{CP}|^{2}=(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}
$$

But $|\mathrm{CP}|=r$

$$
\Rightarrow \quad(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}
$$

The equation of the circle with centre $(h, k)$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-427.jpg?height=487&width=649&top_left_y=1086&top_left_x=986) and radius $r$ is

$$
(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}
$$

## Example 1

Find the equation of the circle with centre $(3,-1)$ and radius 4.
The equation is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$

$$
(x-3)^{2}+(y+1)^{2}=4^{2}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad x^{2}-6 x+9+y^{2}+2 y+1=16 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad x^{2}+y^{2}-6 x+2 y-6=0 \text { is the equation }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

Find the centre and radius of the circle

$$
\begin{aligned}
& (x-3)^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=36 \\
& (x-3)^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=36 \\
& \text { centre }=(3,-4) \quad \text { radius }=\sqrt{36}=6
\end{aligned}
$$

## 2. The general equation of a circle

Consider the equation $(x-3)^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=36$ in Example 2 above

$$
\begin{aligned}
& & (x-3)^{2}+(y+4)^{2} & =36 \\
& \Rightarrow & x^{2}-6 x+9+y^{2}+8 y+16 & =36 \\
& \Rightarrow & x^{2}+y^{2}-6 x+8 y-11 & =0
\end{aligned}
$$

If the equation of a circle is in the form $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0$
(i) the centre $=(-g,-f)$
(ii) the radius $=\sqrt{g^{2}+f^{2}-\mathrm{c}}$, provided $g^{2}+f^{2}-\mathrm{c}>0$

The centre is $(3,-4)$ where 3 is $-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right.$ coefficient of $\left.x\right)$ and -4 is $-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right.$ coefficient of $\left.y\right)$
The radius is $\sqrt{(3)^{2}+(-4)^{2}-(-11)}$

$$
=\sqrt{9+16+11}=\sqrt{36}=6
$$

## Example 3

Find the centre and the radius of the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}-2 x+4 y-8=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Centre } & =\left(-\frac{1}{2} \text { coefficient of } x,-\frac{1}{2} \text { coefficient of } y\right) \\
& =(1,-2) \\
\text { Radius } & =\sqrt{g^{2}+f^{2}-c} \\
& =\sqrt{(1)^{2}+(-2)^{2}-(-8)} \\
& =\sqrt{1+4+8}=\sqrt{13}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad$ the centre $=(1,-2)$ and radius $=\sqrt{13}$

Note: 1. The equation of a circle can be written in two ways
(i) $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2} \ldots$ centre $=(h, k)$ and radius $=r$
(ii) $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0 \ldots$ centre $=(-g,-f)$ and radius $=\sqrt{g^{2}+f^{2}-c}$

3. The equation of circle has these characteristics:

(ii) The coefficients of $x^{2}$ and $y^{2}$ are equal.
(iii) There is no term in $x y$.

$\Rightarrow \mathrm{P}$ is on the circle

$|\mathrm{OP}|<r$
$\Rightarrow \mathrm{P}$ is inside the circle

$\Rightarrow P$ is outside the circle

Note: If the coordinates of a point satisfy the equation of a circle, then that point is on the circle.

## Example 4

Investigate if the point $\mathrm{P}(4,1)$ is inside the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}-6 x+4 y+4=0$.
Centre of circle $=(3,-2)$
Radius of circle $=\sqrt{(3)^{2}+(-2)^{2}-4}=\sqrt{9+4-4}=\sqrt{9}=3$
Distance from $(3,-2)$ to $\mathrm{P}(4,1)$ is

$$
\sqrt{(4-3)^{2}+(1+2)^{2}}=\sqrt{1+9}=\sqrt{10}
$$

Since this distance, i.e. $\sqrt{10}$, is greater than the radius 3 , $\Rightarrow \quad \mathrm{P}(4,1)$ is outside the circle

## Section 11.3 Finding the equation of a circle

To find the equation of a circle we generally require,
(i) the centre and (ii) the radius of the circle.

In the more difficult questions these two pieces of information are not given directly. We have to rely, therefore, on our knowledge of the geometry of the circle to find the centre and the radius.

Three geometrical properties of the circle are particularly important.

1. The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord
In the given figure, $\mathrm{CM} \perp \mathrm{AB}$

$$
|\mathrm{AM}|=|\mathrm{MB}|
$$

The corollary to this theorem is property 2, given below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-432.jpg?height=310&width=314&top_left_y=175&top_left_x=1229)
2. The perpendicular bisector of a chord contains the centre

In the given diagram, $l$ is the perpendicular bisector of the chord $[\mathrm{AB}]$ and $m$ is the perpendicular bisector of the chord [BC].

Each of these bisectors contains the centre, O.
The point of intersection of these two perpendicular bisectors is the centre of the circle.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-432.jpg?height=390&width=359&top_left_y=559&top_left_x=1209)

Note: This property is very useful when we require the equation of a circle containing three given points.
3. The perpendicular to a tangent at the point of contact passes through the centre of the circle
In the given diagram the tangent, $t$, touches the circle at the point P .

The perpendicular to $t$ through P contains the centre O .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-432.jpg?height=338&width=390&top_left_y=1118&top_left_x=1229)

## 1. Equation of circle containing three given points

## Example 1

Find the equation of the circle which contains the points $\mathrm{A}(2,1), \mathrm{B}(0,5)$ and $C(-1,2)$.

The given diagram shows the circle containing the three given points.
$l$ is the perpendicular bisector of [CA]
$m$ is the perpendicular bisector of [BC].
We now find the equations of $l$ and $m$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-432.jpg?height=336&width=477&top_left_y=1718&top_left_x=1065)

Equation of $l$ :
Slope of $\mathrm{AC}=\frac{1-2}{2+1}=-\frac{1}{3}$

$$
\Rightarrow \quad \text { slope of } l=3
$$

Midpoint of $[\mathrm{AC}]=\left(\frac{2-1}{2}, \frac{1+2}{2}\right)$

$$
=\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\right)
$$

Equation of $l$ : point $=\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& & \text { slope } & =3 \\
& & y-\frac{3}{2} & =3\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) \\
\Rightarrow & & y-\frac{3}{2} & =3 x-\frac{3}{2} \\
\Rightarrow & & 2 y-3 & =6 x-3 \\
\Rightarrow & & 6 x-2 y & =0 \\
\Rightarrow & & 3 x-y & =0
\end{aligned}
$$

Equation of $m$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Slope of } \mathrm{BC} & =\frac{5-2}{0+1}=\frac{3}{1}=3 \\
\Rightarrow \quad \text { slope of } m & =-\frac{1}{3} \\
\text { Midpoint of }[\mathrm{BC}] & =\left(\frac{0-1}{2}, \frac{5+2}{2}\right) \\
& =\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{7}{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Equation of $m$ : point $=\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{7}{2}\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { slope }=-\frac{1}{3} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad y-\frac{7}{2}=-\frac{1}{3}\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right) \\
& \Rightarrow \quad y-\frac{7}{2}=-\frac{x}{3}-\frac{1}{6} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad 6 y-21=-2 x-1 \\
& \Rightarrow 2 x+6 y-20=0 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad x+3 y-10=0 \ldots \text { (2) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Solving the equations for $l$ and $m$ we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { (1): } \quad 3 x-y=0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 x-y=0 \\
& \text { (2): } \quad x+3 y=10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{3 x+9 y=30}{-10 y=-30 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y=3}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
y=3 \Rightarrow x=1
$$

$\therefore$ the centre of the circle is $\mathrm{O}(1,3)$.
Radius of the circle is $|\mathrm{OA}|$.

$$
|\mathrm{OA}|=\sqrt{(1-2)^{2}+(3-1)^{2}}=\sqrt{1+4}=\sqrt{5}
$$

Equation of circle with centre $(1,3)$ and radius $\sqrt{5}$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& (x-1)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}=(\sqrt{5})^{2} \\
\Rightarrow \quad(x-1)^{2}+(y-3)^{2} & =5 \text { is the required equation }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Alternative method

The equation of a circle containing three points can also be found by using the general equation of the circle, $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0$. By substituting the three sets of values for $x$ and $y$ we will then have 3 simultaneous equations.
This is illustrated in the following example.

## Example 2

Find the equation of the circle which contains the points $(0,0),(3,1)$ and $(3,9)$.
Let the equation of the circle be $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
(0,0) \in \text { the circle } & \Rightarrow 0+0+0+0+c=0 \Rightarrow c=0 \ldots \text { (1) } \\
(3,1) \in \text { the circle } & \Rightarrow 9+1+6 g+2 f+c=0 \\
& \Rightarrow 6 g+2 f=-10 \ldots \text { (2) } \ldots(c=0) \\
(3,9) \in \text { the circle } & \Rightarrow 9+81+6 g+18 f+c=0 \\
& \Rightarrow 6 g+18 f=-90 \ldots \text { (3) } \ldots(c=0)
\end{aligned}
$$

We now solve equations (2) and (3).

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { (2): } 6 g+2 f=-10 \\
& \text { (3): } \frac{6 g+18 f=-90}{-16 f=80} \\
& \Rightarrow 16 f=-80 \Rightarrow f=-5 \\
& \therefore 6 g+2(-5)=-10 \\
& 6 g=0 \Rightarrow g=0 \\
& \therefore g=0, f=-5 \text { and } c=0
\end{aligned}
$$

We now substitute these values in the equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0 \Rightarrow x^{2}+y^{2}-10 y=0 \text { is the required } \\
& \text { equation }
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: If one of the three points on a circle is $(0,0)$, the method of finding the equation shown in Example 2 may be easier than the method shown in Example 1.

## 2. Equation of circle when given the equation of a tangent, the point of contact and one other point

## Example 3

Find the equation of the circle which touches the line $3 x-4 y-3=0$ at the point $\mathrm{A}(5,3)$ and which passes through the point $\mathrm{B}(-2,4)$.
A rough sketch of the circle is shown on the right.
The centre O lies on the perpendicular bisector of $[\mathrm{AB}]$.
The centre also lies on the line through $\mathrm{A}(5,3)$, perpendicular to the tangent
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-434.jpg?height=475&width=664&top_left_y=1625&top_left_x=927) $3 x-4 y-3=0$.
The centre, O , is the point of intersection of these two lines.
(i) Equation of the perpendicular bisector of $[\mathrm{AB}]$ :

Slope of $\mathrm{AB}=\frac{3-4}{5+2}=-\frac{1}{7}$
$\Rightarrow \quad$ Slope of perpendicular to $\mathrm{AB}=7$
Midpoint of $[\mathrm{AB}]=\left(\frac{-2+5}{2}, \frac{4+3}{2}\right)=\left(\frac{3}{2}, \frac{7}{2}\right)$
Equation of perpendicular bisector of $[\mathrm{AB}]$ :

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
\text { point } & =\left(\frac{3}{2}, \frac{7}{2}\right) ; \quad \text { slope }=7 & \\
y-\frac{7}{2} & =7\left(x-\frac{3}{2}\right) & & \\
\Rightarrow \quad y-\frac{7}{2} & =7 x-\frac{21}{2} & & \\
\Rightarrow \quad & 2 y-7 & =14 x-21 & \Rightarrow \quad 14 x-2 y-14=0 \\
& & \Rightarrow \quad 7 x-y-7=0 \ldots
\end{array}
$$

(ii) Equation of line through A perpendicular to $3 x-4 y-3=0$ :

Slope of $3 x-4 y-3=0$ is $\frac{3}{4} \Rightarrow$ slope of perpendicular line $=-\frac{4}{3}$.
Equation of line: $\quad y-3=-\frac{4}{3}(x-5)$

$$
\begin{array}{lrl}
\Rightarrow & & 3 y-9=-4 x+20 \\
\Rightarrow & & 4 x+3 y-29=0 \ldots \text { (2) }
\end{array}
$$

Solving equations (1) and (2) we get:
(1) $\times 3: \quad 21 x-3 y=21$
(2) : $\frac{4 x+3 y=29}{25 x=50} \Rightarrow x=2$ and $y=7$
$\Rightarrow \quad(2,7)$ is the centre of the circle
The radius of the circle is the distance from $(2,7)$ to $(-2,4)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad \text { the radius } & =\sqrt{(-2-2)^{2}+(4-7)^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{16+9}=\sqrt{25}=5
\end{aligned}
$$

The equation of the circle with centre ( 2,7 ) and radius $=5$ is

$$
(x-2)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=25
$$

3. Equation of circle through two given points with its centre on a given line
The given diagram shows a circle $k$ containing two points A and B and a line $l$ which contains the centre of $k$.

The centre of the circle is found by getting the point of intersection of $l$ and the perpendicular bisector of $[\mathrm{AB}]$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-435.jpg?height=409&width=569&top_left_y=1856&top_left_x=1012)

## Example 4

Find the equation of the circle whose centre is on the line $l$ : $3 x-y-7=0$ and which passes through the points $\mathrm{A}(1,1)$ and $\mathrm{B}(2,-1)$.
$m$ is the perpendicular bisector of $[\mathrm{AB}]$. The centre of the circle is the point of intersection of $m$ and the line $3 x-y-7=0$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-436.jpg?height=486&width=633&top_left_y=384&top_left_x=909)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Midpoint of }[\mathrm{AB}] & =\left(\frac{3}{2}, 0\right) \\
\text { Slope of } \mathrm{AB} & =\frac{-1-1}{2-1} \\
& =-2
\end{aligned}
$$

Slope of $m=\frac{1}{2}$
Equation of $m$ : point $=\left(\frac{3}{2}, 0\right)$ and slope $=\frac{1}{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right) \\
\Rightarrow & y-0=\frac{1}{2}\left(x-\frac{3}{2}\right) \\
\Rightarrow & y=\frac{x}{2}-\frac{3}{4} \\
\Rightarrow & 4 y=2 x-3 \Rightarrow 2 x-4 y-3=0 . . . \text { equation of } m
\end{aligned}
$$

We now find the point of intersection of $\ell$ and $m$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& l: \quad 3 x-y=7 \quad(\times 2): \quad 6 x-2 y=14 \\
& m: \quad 2 x-4 y=3(\times 3): \quad \frac{6 x-12 y=9}{10 y=5} \Rightarrow y=\frac{1}{2} \\
& l: \quad 3 x-\frac{1}{2}=7 \\
& \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 x=7 \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow 3 x=\frac{15}{2} \Rightarrow x=\frac{5}{2} \\
& \quad \therefore \quad \text { centre of circle, } C=\left(\frac{5}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

The radius length is the distance from $\left(\frac{5}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ to $(1,1)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \text { radius } & =\sqrt{\left(\frac{5}{2}-1\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{1}{2}-1\right)^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{\frac{9}{4}+\frac{1}{4}}=\sqrt{\frac{10}{4}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The equation of the circle is $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow\left(x-\frac{5}{2}\right)^{2}+\left(y-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}=\frac{10}{4} \\
& \Rightarrow\left(x-\frac{5}{2}\right)^{2}+\left(y-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}=\frac{5}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note 1. The question in Example 4 may also be done by using the general equation $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0$.
By substituting the points $(1,1)$ and $(2,-1)$ we get two equations in $g, f$ and $c$.
Since the line $3 x-y-7=0$ contains the centre ( $-g,-f$ ), we get the equation $-3 g+f-7=0$.
We then solve the three equations to get the values of $g, f$ and $c$.
2. A line is a tangent to a circle if it touches the circle at one point only.
Also, the perpendicular distance from the centre of a circle to a tangent is equal to the radius of the circle.

## 3. Showing that a line is a tangent to a circle

A line is a tangent to a circle if the perpendicular distance from the centre of the circle to the line
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-437.jpg?height=352&width=406&top_left_y=479&top_left_x=1228) is equal to the radius.

## Example 5

Show that the line $x+6 y-9=0$ is a tangent to the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}-4 x+10 y-8=0$.

The centre of the circle $=(2,-5)$ and radius $=\sqrt{(2)^{2}+(-5)^{2}+8}=\sqrt{37}$.
The perpendicular distance from $(2,-5)$ to the line $x+6 y-9=0$ is

$$
\frac{|2(1)+6(-5)-9|}{\sqrt{1^{2}+6^{2}}}=\frac{|2-30-9|}{\sqrt{37}}=\frac{|-37|}{\sqrt{37}}=\frac{37 \sqrt{37}}{37}=\sqrt{37}
$$

Since this perpendicular distance is equal to the radius,
$\Rightarrow$ the line is a tangent to the circle

## Exercise 11.3

## Section 11.4 Tangents to a circle

A line is a tangent to a circle if it intersects the circle at one and only one point.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-440.jpg?height=310&width=404&top_left_y=255&top_left_x=1194)

## 1. Finding the equation of the tangent to a circle at the point $P$ on the circle

In the given diagram, $t$ is a tangent to the circle at the point P and C is the centre of the circle.
CP is perpendicular to $t$.
To find the equation of $t$ :
(i) Find the slope of CP.
(ii) Write down the slope of $t$.
(iii) Find the equation of $t$ using
$y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right)$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-440.jpg?height=493&width=565&top_left_y=687&top_left_x=1066)

## Example 1

The centre of the circle is $\mathrm{C}(2,-1)$.
Slope of $\mathrm{CP}=\frac{-1+5}{2-5}=\frac{4}{-3}=-\frac{4}{3}$
$\Rightarrow$ slope of $t=\frac{3}{4}$
Equation of $t: \quad y+5=\frac{3}{4}(x-5)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad 4 y+20 & =3 x-15 \\
\Rightarrow \quad 3 x-4 y-35 & =0 \text { is the equation of the tangent }
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-440.jpg?height=437&width=581&top_left_y=1328&top_left_x=961)

## 2. Tangents to a circle parallel or perpendicular to a given line

Parallel and perpendicular lines.

1. Any line parallel to $a x+b y+c=0$ has equation $\quad a x+b y+k=0$
2. Any line perpendicular to $a x+b y+c=0$ has equation $b x-a y+k=0$

## Example 2

Find the equations of the two lines parallel to the line $3 x+4 y-6=0$ and which are tangents to the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$.

A sketch of the line and circle are shown.
The two tangents parallel to $3 x+4 y-6=0$ are shown in red.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-441.jpg?height=475&width=645&top_left_y=272&top_left_x=946)

The equation of any line parallel to $3 x+4 y-6=0$ is $3 x+4 y+k=0$.
The radius of the circle is $\sqrt{25}=5$.
The perpendicular distance from the centre of the circle, $(0,0)$, to $3 x+4 y+k=0$ is equal to 5 .
$\Rightarrow \frac{|3(0)+4(0)+k|}{\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}}=5$
$\Rightarrow \frac{|k|}{5}=5$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { If }|x|=5 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad x=5 \quad \text { or } \quad x=-5
\end{aligned}
$$

$\Rightarrow \frac{k}{5}=5 \quad$ or $\quad \frac{k}{5}=-5$
$\Rightarrow k=25$ or $k=-25$
The equations of the two tangents are

$$
3 x+4 y+25=0 \quad \text { or } \quad 3 x+4 y-25=0
$$

## 3. Tangents to a circle from a point $\mathbf{P}$ not on the circle

The diagram below illustrates that two tangents can be drawn to a circle from a point outside the circle, i.e. PA and PB are tangents to the circle $k$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-441.jpg?height=399&width=711&top_left_y=1703&top_left_x=564)

If we are asked to find the equations of the two tangents from the point $(2,3)$, for example, to a given circle, we first find in terms of the slope, $m$, the equation of any line through $(2,3)$.

This equation is $\quad y-3=m(x-2)$

$$
\text { i.e. } \quad m x-y+3-2 m=0 \text {. }
$$

We then find the perpendicular distance from the centre of the circle to this line and equate it to the radius to find the two values of $m$.

## Remember

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { The perpendicular distance from the } \\
& \text { point }\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right) \text { to the line } \\
& a x+b y+c=0 \text { is } \\
& \qquad d=\frac{\left|a x_{1}+b y_{1}+c\right|}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

Find the equations of the tangents to the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=5$ from the point $(5,0)$.
The equation of any line through $(5,0)$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right) \\
\Rightarrow & y-0=m(x-5) \\
\Rightarrow & y=m(x-5) \\
\Rightarrow & m x-y-5 m=0
\end{aligned}
$$

Centre of circle $=(0,0)$
Radius of circle $=\sqrt{5}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-442.jpg?height=434&width=678&top_left_y=957&top_left_x=863)

If the line $m x-y-5 m=0$ is a tangent to the circle, then the perpendicular distance from the centre of the circle, i.e. $(0,0)$, to the line is equal in length to the radius.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow & \frac{|0 \cdot m+0(-1)-5 m|}{\sqrt{m^{2}+(-1)^{2}}}=\sqrt{5} \\
& =\frac{|-5 m|}{\sqrt{m^{2}+1}}=\sqrt{5} \\
\Rightarrow & \frac{25 m^{2}}{m^{2}+1}=5 \\
\Rightarrow & 25 m^{2}=5\left(m^{2}+1\right) \\
\Rightarrow & 20 m^{2}=5 \\
\Rightarrow & m^{2}=\frac{1}{4} \Rightarrow m= \pm \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The equations of the tangents are

$$
\begin{aligned}
& m=\frac{1}{2}: \quad y-0 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad 2 y=\frac{1}{2}(x-5) \\
& \Rightarrow \quad x-2 y-5=0 \\
& m=-\frac{1}{2}: \quad y-0=-\frac{1}{2}(x-5) \\
& 2 y=-x+5 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad x+2 y-5=0
\end{aligned}
$$

The equations of the two tangents are

$$
x-2 y-5=0 \quad \text { and } \quad x+2 y-5=0 .
$$

## 4. Length of a tangent to a circle from a given point

When dealing with problems involving tangents, it is important to remember that the line joining the centre of the circle to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-443.jpg?height=369&width=757&top_left_y=339&top_left_x=541)

We will use this information to find the length of a tangent to a circle from a given point.

This is illustrated in the following example.

To find the length of the tangent $[\mathrm{PT}]$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
|\mathrm{CP}|^{2} & =|\mathrm{PT}|^{2}+|\mathrm{CT}|^{2} \\
\Rightarrow \quad|\mathrm{PT}|^{2} & =|\mathrm{CP}|^{2}-|\mathrm{CT}|^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 4

Find the length of the tangent from the point $(-5,8)$ to the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}-4 x-6 y+3=0$.

The centre of the circle is $(2,3)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { The radius } & =\sqrt{g^{2}+f^{2}-c} \\
& =\sqrt{4+9-3}=\sqrt{10} \\
\Rightarrow \quad|\mathrm{CT}| & =\sqrt{10} \\
|\mathrm{CP}| & =\sqrt{(2+5)^{2}+(3-8)^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{49+25}=\sqrt{74}
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-443.jpg?height=409&width=501&top_left_y=1172&top_left_x=1041)

Since $\triangle \mathrm{CTP}$ is right-angled $\Rightarrow|\mathrm{PT}|^{2}=|\mathrm{CP}|^{2}-|\mathrm{CT}|^{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =74-10=64 \\
\Rightarrow \quad|\mathrm{PT}| & =\sqrt{64}=8
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore$ the length of the tangent is 8

## Section 11.5 Lines and circles: Common chord

## 1. Points of intersection of a line and a circle

We use simultaneous equations to find the point(s) of intersection of a line and a circle.
If there are two solutions, then the line intersects the circle at two points.
If there is only one point of intersection, the line is a tangent to the circle, as shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-446.jpg?height=397&width=1003&top_left_y=794&top_left_x=420)

## Example 1

Find the points of intersection of the line $x+2 y-1=0$ and the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 x+8 y-8=0$.

We start with the equation of the line and express $x$ in terms of $y$ or $y$ in terms of $x$. (Avoid fractions, if possible.)

$$
x+2 y-1=0 \Rightarrow x=-2 y+1
$$

We now substitute $(-2 y+1)$ for $x$ in the equation of the circle.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrlrl} 
& & (-2 y+1)^{2}+y^{2}+2(-2 y+1)+8 y-8 & =0 \\
& \Rightarrow & 4 y^{2}-4 y+1+y^{2}-4 y+2+8 y-8 & =0 \\
& \Rightarrow & 5 y^{2}-5=0 \Rightarrow & y^{2}-1 & =0 \\
& \Rightarrow & (y-1)(y+1) & =0 \\
& \Rightarrow & y=1 \text { or } y & =-1
\end{array}
$$

For each value for $y$, we find the corresponding $x$-value.

$$
y=1 \Rightarrow x=-1 ; \quad y=-1 \Rightarrow x=3
$$

The points of intersection are $(-1,1)$ and $(3,-1)$.

## Example 2

Find the point(s) of intersection of the line $2 x-y+8=0$ and the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}+4 x+2 y=0$ and hence show that the line is a tangent to the circle.

Line: $2 x-y+8=0 \Rightarrow y=2 x+8$
Circle:

$$
\text { le } \begin{aligned}
& & x^{2}+(2 x+8)^{2}+4 x+2(2 x+8) & =0 \\
& \Rightarrow & x^{2}+4 x^{2}+32 x+64+4 x+4 x+16 & =0 \\
& \Rightarrow & 5 x^{2}+40 x+80 & =0 \\
& \Rightarrow & x^{2}+8 x+16 & =0 \\
& \Rightarrow & (x+4)(x+4) & =0 \\
& \Rightarrow & x & =-4 \ldots \text { one value only }
\end{aligned}
$$

The corresponding $y$ value is: $2(-4)-y+8=0 \Rightarrow y=0$
The point of intersection is $(-4,0)$.
Since there is only one point of intersection, the line is a tangent to the circle.

## 2. Where a circle intersects the axes

A circle intersects the $x$-axis at the points where $y=0$.
A circle intersects the $y$-axis at the points where $x=0$.

## Example 3

Find the length of the intercept the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}-10 x+8 y+16=0$ makes on the $x$-axis.

The circle intersects the $x$-axis at the points where $y=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y=0 & \Rightarrow x^{2}-10 x+16=0 \\
& \Rightarrow(x-8)(x-2)=0 \\
& \Rightarrow x=8 \text { or } x=2
\end{aligned}
$$

The circle intersects the $x$-axis at $(2,0)$ and $(8,0)$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-447.jpg?height=376&width=392&top_left_y=1406&top_left_x=1181)
$\therefore \quad$ the intercept on the $x$-axis is 6 .

## 3. The common chord or common tangent of two circles

Take the circles $s_{1}$ : $\quad x^{2}+y^{2}-4 x-2 y-4=0$
$\begin{aligned} \text { and } s_{2}: & x^{2}+y^{2}-6 x+4 y-3=0 \\ s_{1}-s_{2}: & 2 x-6 y-1=0\end{aligned}$

This is the equation of the line which passes through the points of intersection of the two circles.
(i) If the two circles intersect, then the line is the common chord of the two circles.
(ii) If the circles touch internally or externally, then the line is the common tangent.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-448.jpg?height=390&width=573&top_left_y=352&top_left_x=350)

Common chord
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-448.jpg?height=347&width=555&top_left_y=397&top_left_x=934)

Common tangent

The points of intersection of two circles may be found by following these steps:
(i) find the equation of the common chord
(ii) find the points of intersection of the chord and any one of the circles.

## Example 4

Find the equation of the common chord of the two circles $x^{2}+y^{2}-6 x+2 y+4=0$ and $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 x-4 y-6=0$.

The equation of the common chord is

The common chord of two circles $s_{1}=0$ and $s_{2}=0$ is $s_{1}-s_{2}=0$.

$$
\Rightarrow \quad-8 x+6 y+10=0
$$

$\Rightarrow 4 x-3 y-5=0$ is the required equation

Note: The points of intersection of the two circles in Example 4 above are found by solving the equations $4 x-3 y-5=0$ and $x^{2}+y^{2}-6 x+2 y+4=0$.

## 1. Circles touching externally or internally

Two circles touch if they meet at one point only.
If two circles touch externally, then the distance between their centres is equal to the sum of their radii. In the given diagram $d$ is the distance between the two centres.
Since the circles touch externally,

$$
d=r_{1}+r_{2}
$$

If two circles touch internally, then the distance between their centres is equal to the difference of their radii.
In the given diagram,

$$
d=r_{1}-r_{2}
$$

## Example 1

Show that the circles $s_{1}: x^{2}+y^{2}-6 x-4 y+11=0$

$$
\text { and } s_{2}: x^{2}+y^{2}+4 x+6 y-19=0 \text { touch externally. }
$$

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
s_{1}: & x^{2}+y^{2}-6 x-4 y+11=0 \Rightarrow \\
s_{2}: & x^{2}+y^{2}+4 x+6 y-19=0 \Rightarrow
\end{array} \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { centre }=(3,2) \text { and } \\
& \text { radius }=\sqrt{3^{2}+2^{2}-11}=\sqrt{2} \\
&
\end{aligned} \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { centre }=(-2,-3) \text { and } \\
& \text { radius }=\sqrt{(-2)^{2}+(-3)^{2}+19}=\sqrt{32}=4 \sqrt{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Distance between the centres $=\sqrt{(3+2)^{2}+(2+3)^{2}}=\sqrt{50}$

$$
=5 \sqrt{2}
$$

Sum of the two radii $=\sqrt{2}+4 \sqrt{2}=5 \sqrt{2}$
Since the distance between the centres $=$ the sum of the radii $=5 \sqrt{2}$, the circles touch externally.

## 2. Chords and circles

We have already encountered the very useful geometrical property of the circle which states that:

The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord.

In the given diagram, $d$ is the length of the perpendicular from the centre, O , to the chord.

We use the Theorem of Pythagoras to find $d, r$ or $p$ as required.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-451.jpg?height=314&width=317&top_left_y=173&top_left_x=1315)

## Example 2

A circle $k$ has centre $\mathrm{C}(4,2)$ and makes a chord 6 units in length on the $y$-axis. Find the equation of $k$.

If the centre is $(4,2)$, then the length of the perpendicular $[\mathrm{BC}]$ is 4 units.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-451.jpg?height=486&width=551&top_left_y=766&top_left_x=658)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& |\mathrm{AB}|=\frac{1}{2} \text { length of chord on } y \text {-axis } \\
\Rightarrow \quad & |\mathrm{AB}|=3 \\
& |\mathrm{AC}|^{2}=3^{2}+4^{2} \\
\Rightarrow \quad & |\mathrm{AC}|^{2}=25 \Rightarrow|\mathrm{AC}|=5 \Rightarrow \text { radius }=5
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad$ the circle has centre $(4,2)$ and radius 5
Equation of circle: $(x-4)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=25$

## Exercise 11.6

## Section 11.7 Circles touching the $\boldsymbol{x}$-axis or $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis

If a circle touches the $x$-axis or $y$-axis, then the radius of the circle is equal to one of coordinates of its centre.

## 1. Circle touching the $\boldsymbol{x}$-axis

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-453.jpg?height=338&width=494&top_left_y=1495&top_left_x=319)

Radius $=|-f|$
$\Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{g^{2}+f^{2}-c}=|-f|$
$\Rightarrow \quad g^{2}+f^{2}-c=f^{2}$
$\Rightarrow \quad g^{2}-c=0$
$\Rightarrow \quad g^{2}=c$

## 2. Circle touching the $y$-axis

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-453.jpg?height=366&width=402&top_left_y=1465&top_left_x=1074)

Radius $=|-g|$
$\Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{g^{2}+f^{2}-c}=|-g|$
$\Rightarrow \quad g^{2}+f^{2}-c=g^{2}$
$\Rightarrow \quad f^{2}-c=0$
$\Rightarrow \quad f^{2}=c$

## Example 1

Find the equations of the two circles which contain the points $(3,-2)$ and $(2,-1)$ and which touch the $x$-axis.

Let the equation of the circle be

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}+2 g x+2 f y+c=0 .
$$

$(2,-1) \in$ the circle

$$
\begin{align*}
\Rightarrow & & 4+1+2 g(2)+2 f(-1)+c & =0 \\
\Rightarrow & & 4 g-2 f+c & =-5 \tag{1}
\end{align*}
$$

$(3,-2) \in$ the circle
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-454.jpg?height=406&width=491&top_left_y=358&top_left_x=1058)

$$
\begin{align*}
\Rightarrow & & 9+4+2 g(3)+2 f(-2)+c & =0 \\
\Rightarrow & & 6 g-4 f+c & =-13 \ldots \tag{2}
\end{align*}
$$

If the circle touches the $x$-axis, the radius $=|-f|$

$$
\begin{align*}
\Rightarrow & & \sqrt{g^{2}+f^{2}-c} & =|-f| \\
\Rightarrow & & g^{2}+f^{2}-c & =f^{2} \\
\Rightarrow & & g^{2} & =c \ldots \tag{3}
\end{align*}
$$

We now use equations (1) and (2) to eliminate $f$.
(1): $4 g-2 f+c=-5$
(1) $\times 2: \quad 8 g-4 f+2 c=-10$
(2): $6 g-4 f+c=-13$
(2): $\begin{aligned} 6 g-4 f+c & =-13 \\ 2 g+c & =3 \\ \Rightarrow c & =-2 g+3\end{aligned}$

We now substitute $(-2 g+3)$ for $c$ in equation (3)
(3): $g^{2}=c$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow & & g^{2} & =-2 g+3 \\
\Rightarrow & & g^{2}+2 g-3 & =0 \\
\Rightarrow & & (g-1)(g+3) & =0 \\
\Rightarrow & & g=1 \text { or } g & =-3
\end{aligned}
$$

$g=1 \Rightarrow c=-2(1)+3 \Rightarrow c=1$
$g=-3 \Rightarrow c=-2(-3)+3 \Rightarrow c=9$
Substituting these values for $g$ and $c$ in equation (1) we get:

$$
4 g-2 f+c=-5 \ldots
$$

$$
\begin{array}{llrl}
g=1 \text { and } c=1: & & 4(1)-2 f+1=-5 \\
& \Rightarrow & -2 f=-10 \Rightarrow f=5 \\
g=-3 \text { and } c=9 & \Rightarrow & 4(-3)-2 f+9=-5 \\
& \Rightarrow & -12-2 f+9=-5 \\
& \Rightarrow & -2 f=-2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f=1
\end{array}
$$

The two sets of values for $g, f$ and $c$ are
Circle 1: $g=1, f=5$ and $c=1 \quad$ Circle 2: $\quad g=-3, f=1$ and $c=9$
Circle 1: $\quad x^{2}+y^{2}+2 x+10 y+1=0$
Circle 2: $\quad x^{2}+y^{2}-6 x+2 y+9=0$

## Section 12.1 Revision

The inequality symbols $>, \geqslant,<, \leqslant$ are needed when solving problems in which a range of possible values satisfy the given conditions.
e.g. If $3 x-4>5$,

$$
3 x>9,
$$

and $x>3$, which means that all values of $\boldsymbol{x}$ greater than 3 satisfy $3 x-4>5$.
$>$ greater than
$\geqslant$ greater than or equal to
$<$ less than
$\leqslant$ less than or equal to

An expression such as $3 x-4>5$ is called an inequality.

## Basic rules of inequalities

| Adding or subtracting a <br> constant, $a$ | $x>y$ | $x \pm a>y \pm a$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Multiplying or dividing <br> by a positive number, <br> $a>0$ | $x>y$ | $a x>a y$ |
|  |  | $\frac{x}{a}>\frac{y}{a}$ |

When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality symbol is reversed.
E.g. $5>2$; if both sides are multiplied by ( -1 ), we get $5 \times(-1)<2 \times(-1)$, i.e. $-5<-2$.

| Multiplying or dividing <br> by a negative number, <br> $a<0$ | $x>y$ | $a x<a y$ <br> $\frac{x}{a}<\frac{y}{a}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

Also,

| Combining inequalities | $x>y$ <br> $y>z$ | $x>z$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  | $x>y>0$ | $a x>b y$ |
|  | $a>b>0$ |  |

If a graph of the function is given or is easily constructed, this provides an extra technique in helping to understand and solve inequalities.

If $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x})=(\boldsymbol{x}+\mathbf{3})(\boldsymbol{x}-\mathbf{1})(\boldsymbol{x}-\mathbf{4}) \geqslant \mathbf{0}$,
then the points $x=-3, x=1$ and $x=4$ are the critical points in determining the solution set.

The set of values of $x$ for which

$$
f(x)=(x+3)(x-1)(x-4) \geqslant 5
$$

can also be estimated.

(i) When solving inequalities, the solution is often restricted to specific number systems, i.e. $\in N, \in Z, \in R$, and the resulting range of numbers plotted on the number line. e.g. $5 x-1>14, x \in N$.
(ii) An inequality creates an ordered pair ( $a, b$ );

If $a>b$, then if the order is reversed ( $b, a$ ), the inequality is also reversed, i.e. $b<a$.

## Example 1

Solve the inequality $3 x+7 \geqslant x+2, x \in Z$, and plot the solution on a number line.

$$
\begin{aligned}
3 x+7 & \geqslant x+2 \\
2 x+7 & \geqslant 2 \ldots \text { subtracting } x \text { from both sides } \\
2 x & \geqslant-5 \ldots \text { subtracting } 7 \text { from both sides } \\
x & \geqslant \frac{-5}{2}, x \in Z .
\end{aligned}
$$

(All integer values greater than or equal to $-2 \frac{1}{2}$ will satisfy the original inequality.)

## Example 2

Solve the inequality $\frac{1}{6}(x-1) \geqslant \frac{1}{3}(x-4), x \in \mathrm{R}$.
Graph your solution on a number line.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{6}(x-1) \geqslant \frac{1}{3}(x-4) \\
& \Rightarrow x-1 \geqslant 2 x-8 \ldots \text { multiplying both sides by } 6 \\
& \Rightarrow-x \geqslant-7 \ldots \text { adding } 1 \text { and subtracting } 2 x \text { from both sides } \\
& \Rightarrow x \leqslant 7 \ldots \text { multiplying both sides by }(-1) \text { and reversing the inequality sign. }
\end{aligned}
$$

(Note: A closed circle on 7 indicates that 7 is included in the range.)

## Example 3

Solve the inequality $-9<3-4 x \leqslant 1, x \in \mathrm{R}$.
Graph your solution on the number line.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \begin{aligned}
-9<3-4 x & \leqslant 1 \\
\Rightarrow-12<-4 x & \leqslant-2
\end{aligned} \quad \ldots \text { subtracting } 3 \text { from each part of the inequality } \\
& \quad \Rightarrow 3>x \geqslant \frac{1}{2} \quad \ldots \text { dividing each part of the inequality by }-4 \text { and reversing } \\
& \quad \text { the inequality symbol } \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \leqslant x<3 \quad \ldots \text { reversing the order } \\
& \hdashline-1 \quad-0.5 \quad 0 \quad 1 \quad 0.5 \quad 1 \quad 1.5 \quad 2
\end{aligned}
$$

(Note: An open circle on 3 indicates that it is not to be included.)

## Example 4

(i) Find the solution set $A,\{x \mid 7 \leqslant 10-3 x, x \in R\}$.
(ii) Find the solution set $B,\left\{x \left\lvert\, 2>\frac{4}{3}-2 x\right., x \in R\right\}$.
(iii) Find the set $A \cap B$ and graph the solution on the number line.

$$
\begin{aligned}
A: 7 & \leqslant 10-3 x \\
3 x & \leqslant 3 \\
x & \leqslant 1
\end{aligned} \left\lvert\, \begin{aligned}
B: 2 & >\frac{4}{3}-2 x \\
2 x & >\frac{4}{3}-2 \\
2 x & >\frac{-2}{3} \\
x & >\frac{-1}{3}
\end{aligned}\right.
$$

$\therefore \quad A \cap B$ is the set of values $\frac{-1}{3}<x \leqslant 1$.

## Section 12.2 Quadratic and rational inequalities

## 1. Quadratic inequalities

$\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{x}^{\mathbf{2}}+\boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{c} \geqslant \mathbf{0}$ is an example of a quadratic inequality.
To solve a quadratic inequality of the form $a x^{2}+b x+c \geqslant 0$ (or $\leqslant 0$ ), proceed as follows:

1. Solve $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$ to find the (real) roots of the quadratic equation.
2. Draw a rough sketch of the graph using these roots.
(i) If $a>0$, the graph is $\cup$-shaped.
(ii) If $a<0$, the graph is $\cap$-shaped.
3. Use the graph to find the set of values of $x$ that satisfies the inequality.

## Example 1

Solve the inequality $x^{2}-2 x-8 \leqslant 0$.
Step 1. Solve $x^{2}-2 x-8=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow x^{2}-2 x-8=(x+2)(x-4)=0 \\
& \Rightarrow x=-2 \text { or } x=4
\end{aligned}
$$

Step 2. Since $a=+1$, i.e. $>0, \therefore a \cup$-shaped graph.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-464.jpg?height=413&width=640&top_left_y=1637&top_left_x=590)

Step 3. The solution of the inequality is the set of values of $x$ that produces the points of the graph that are on or below the $x$-axis, i.e. $x^{2}-2 x-8 \leqslant 0$. The solution is $-2 \leqslant x \leqslant 4$.

Questions involving values for which the roots of an equation are real, i.e. $b^{2}-4 a c \geqslant 0$, result in quadratic inequalities as shown in the following example.

## Example 2

Find the range of values of $k$ for which the equation $x^{2}+(k-4) x+(k-1)=0$ has real roots.

Condition for real roots: $b^{2}-4 a c \geqslant 0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a=1, b=(k-4), c=(k-1) \\
& \Rightarrow b^{2}-4 a c=(k-4)^{2}-4(1)(k-1) \\
& \quad=k^{2}-8 k+16-4 k+4 \\
& \quad=k^{2}-12 k+20
\end{aligned} \quad \begin{aligned}
b^{2}-4 a c \geqslant 0 & \Rightarrow k^{2}-12 k+20 \geqslant 0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-465.jpg?height=449&width=661&top_left_y=504&top_left_x=900)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { (i) Solving } k^{2}-12 k+20=0 \text {; } \\
& \Rightarrow(k-2)(k-10)=0 \\
& \Rightarrow k=2 \text { and } k=10 \text { are the roots. }
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) Sketch the graph; $a=+1$, i.e. $>0$, $\therefore$ a $\cup$-shaped graph.

The solution of the inequality is the set of values of $k$ that produces points on a graph that are on or above the $k$-axis, i.e. $k^{2}-12 k+20 \geqslant 0$.
The solution is $k \leqslant 2$ and $k \geqslant 10$.

## 2. Rational inequalities

$f(x)=\frac{3 x-2}{x+1}$ is a rational function as the denominator and numerator are both polynomials in $x$.
$\frac{3 x-2}{x+1} \geqslant 2$ is a rational inequality.
Since we do not know if ( $x+1$ ) is positive or negative, we cannot simply multiply both sides by ( $x+1$ ) when solving for $x$ as the inequality symbol would have to be reversed if ( $x+1$ ) was negative.

However, if we multiply both sides by $(x+1)^{2}$, we can retain the same inequality sign since $(x+1)^{2}$ is always positive.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \frac{3 x-2}{x+1} \times(x+1)^{2} \geqslant 2 \times(x+1)^{2} \\
& \Rightarrow(3 x-2)(x+1) \geqslant 2\left(x^{2}+2 x+1\right) \\
& \Rightarrow 3 x^{2}+x-2 \geqslant 2 x^{2}+4 x+2 \\
& \Rightarrow x^{2}-3 x-4 \geqslant 0, \quad \text { creating a quadratic inequality (with the same solution set) } \\
& \quad \text { from the rational inequality. }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

Find the range of values of $x$ for which $\frac{2 x+1}{x+2}<\frac{1}{2}$.
Since $\frac{2 x+1}{x+2}<\frac{1}{2}$,
multiply both sides by $(x+2)^{2}$.
$\left[(x+2)^{2}\right.$ is always positive for all values of $x$.]
$\Rightarrow \frac{2 x+1}{x+2} \times(x+2)^{2}<\frac{1}{2} \times(x+2)^{2}$
$\Rightarrow(2 x+1)(x+2)<\frac{1}{2}\left(x^{2}+4 x+4\right)$
$\Rightarrow 2 x^{2}+5 x+2<\frac{1}{2}\left(x^{2}+4 x+4\right)$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-466.jpg?height=446&width=555&top_left_y=376&top_left_x=1017)
$\Rightarrow 4 x^{2}+10 x+4<x^{2}+4 x+4$
$\Rightarrow 3 x^{2}+6 x<0$
$\Rightarrow x^{2}+2 x<0$.
[Note: $\frac{2 x+1}{x+2}<\frac{1}{2}$ has the same solution set as $x^{2}+2 x<0$.]
(i) Solving the equation $x^{2}+2 x=0$;
(ii) Sketch the graph; $a=+1$, i.e. $>0$,
$\Rightarrow(x)(x+2)=0$
$\therefore \quad$ a $\cup$-shaped graph.
$\Rightarrow x=0$ and $x=-2$ are the roots.
$\Rightarrow$ The solution of the inequality is the set values of $x$ that produces points on the graph that are below the $x$-axis (i.e. $x^{2}+2 x<0$ ).
The solution is $-2<x<0$.

## Section 12.3 Modulus

## 1. Modular equations

The modulus of a number is a measure of its size or magnitude and is written as $|x|$.
$|3|=3,|-4|=4,|15.5|=15.5,|-6.2|=6.2 \ldots$ in other words, for all $x \in R,|x|$ is the positive value of the number.

If $|x|=a$, then $x=+a$ or $-a$ and $|x|^{2}=a^{2}$.

Conversely, if $|x|=6$, then $x=+6$ or -6 .
And therefore, $|x|^{2}=36$.
Geometrically, the modulus function multiplies any negative part of the graph by $(-1)$.
Compare the following graphs:
$y=x$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-469.jpg?height=310&width=307&top_left_y=920&top_left_x=273)
$y=|x|$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-469.jpg?height=310&width=307&top_left_y=920&top_left_x=603)
$y=2 x-3$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-469.jpg?height=357&width=308&top_left_y=920&top_left_x=933)
$y=|2 x-3|$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-469.jpg?height=357&width=308&top_left_y=920&top_left_x=1263)

The graph of $f(x)=|x|$ is found from the graph of $f(x)=x$ by reflecting, in the $x$-axis, that part of the graph for which $f(x)<0$.

## Example 1

Sketch the graph of $f(x)=|3 x+5|$ and hence solve the equation $|3 x+5|=2$
(i) graphically and
(ii) algebraically.
(i) Graphically:

Given $f(x)=3 x+5$.
At $x=0, f(x)=5 \Rightarrow(0,5)$ is the $f(x)$ intercept.
At $f(x)=0 ; 0=3 x+5 \Rightarrow x=\frac{-5}{3} \Rightarrow\left(\frac{-5}{3}, 0\right)$ is the $x$-axis intercept.
$f(x)=3 x+5$ is the line passing through $(0,5)$ and $\left(\frac{-5}{3}, 0\right)$.

Reflecting the negative region of the graph in the $x$-axis creates the graph of $f(x)=|3 x+5|$.

The $x$-coordinates of the intersection points of $f(x)=|3 x+5|$ and $f(x)=2$ give the solution to the equation $|3 x+5|=2$.
The $x$-coordinates are $x=-1$ and $x \cong-2.3$.
(ii) Algebraically:

## Method 1

Since $|3 x+5|=2$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow 3 x+5=+2 \quad \therefore x=-1 \\
& \text { or } 3 x+5=-2 \quad \therefore x=\frac{-7}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

The solution is $x=\frac{-7}{3}$ or $x=-1$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-470.jpg?height=500&width=485&top_left_y=238&top_left_x=1054)

## Method 2

$|3 x+5|=2$
$\Rightarrow(3 x+5)^{2}=(2)^{2}$
$\Rightarrow 9 x^{2}+30 x+25=4$
$\Rightarrow 9 x^{2}+30 x+21=0$
$\Rightarrow 3 x^{2}+10 x+7=0$
$\Rightarrow(3 x+7)(x+1)=0$
$\Rightarrow$ The solution is $\left(-\frac{7}{3},-1\right)$

Note 1: The method of "squaring both sides" of a modular equation can be useful when the modulus sign appears on both sides of the equation, e.g. $|3 x+5|=|x-2|$.

Note 2: Getting the modulus of an expression is sometimes referred to as getting the absolute value of the expression.

## 2. Modular inequalities

If $|x|<1$, then the value of $x$ must lie between +1 and -1 , i.e. $-1<x<+1$.
If $|x|>1$, then the value of $x$ must lie outside this range, i.e. $x>1$ or $x<-1$.

## Example 2

Sketch the graph of $f(x)=|2 x-5|$ and hence solve the inequality

$$
|2 x-5|<3
$$

$f(x)=2 x-5$ is drawn first by using two points on the line, e.g. $(2.5,0)$ and $(4,3)$.
$f(x)=|2 x-5|$ is then drawn by reflecting the negative portion of the graph in the $x$-axis as before.

Drawing the line $f(x)=3$ on the same axes, the red segment represents where $|2 x-5|<3$.

The $x$-values that create that portion of the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-471.jpg?height=404&width=489&top_left_y=239&top_left_x=1054) graph are $1<x<4$.

Note: If $|2 x-5|=3$, then $2 x-5=3$ or $2 x-5=-3$.
If $|2 x-5|<3$, then $-3<2 x-5<3$.

$$
\begin{array}{rrl}
\therefore \quad & 2<2 x<8 & \ldots \text { adding } 5 \text { to each part of the inequality } \\
& 1<x<4 & \ldots \text { dividing each part of the inequality by } 2
\end{array}
$$

This produces the same solution set as above.

## Example 3

Draw a graph of $f(x)=|x+3|$ and $f(x)=|3 x-7|$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& |x+3|<|3 x-7| \\
\Rightarrow & (x+3)^{2}<(3 x-7)^{2} \\
\Rightarrow & x^{2}+6 x+9<9 x^{2}-42 x+49 \\

## Section 12.4 Mathematical proof

In mathematics, we use deductive reasoning to prove that a statement is always true.
The statement, when proved true, then becomes a theorem. e.g. Pythagoras' theorem.
The different methods of proof include direct proofs, proofs by contradiction and proofs by induction (see Section 12.12).

## 1. Direct proof

Direct proof uses axioms, definitions and other proven theorems to verify the new statement.

## Example 1

Prove that the sum of two even integers $x$ and $y$ is always even.

## Proof:

Since $x$ is even, we can write it as $x=2 a$, where $a \in Z$.
Also since $y$ is even, $y=2 b$, where $b \in Z$.
Therefore, $x+y=2 a+2 b=2(a+b)$.
Since $x+y$ has a factor of $2 \Rightarrow x+y$ must be even.
$\therefore$ The sum of two even integers is always even.

## 2. Proof by contradiction

In a proof by contradiction, we show that if we claim some statement to be true, then a logical contradiction occurs which proves that the original statement must be false.

## Example 2

Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
Proof: Assume $\sqrt{2}$ is a rational number.
$\therefore \quad \sqrt{2}$ can be written as $\frac{a}{b}: a, b \in Z$ and $b \neq 0$, and $a$ and $b$ have no common factor.
$\therefore \quad 2=\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}} \ldots$ squaring both sides
$\therefore \quad a^{2}=2 b^{2}$
$\therefore a^{2}$ is even since it is equal to $2 \times\left(b^{2}\right) \ldots$.any integer multiplied by 2 is even
$\therefore \quad a$ is even
$\therefore a$ can be written as $a=2 c \ldots$ since $a$ is divisible by 2
$\therefore \quad a^{2}=4 c^{2}=2 b^{2}$
$\therefore \quad 2 c^{2}=b^{2}$
$\therefore b$ is also even
$\therefore \quad a$ and $b$ have a common factor of 2 which contradicts our assumption.
$\therefore \sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number.
$\therefore \quad \sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number, i.e. it cannot be written as $\frac{a}{b}$ with no common factors.

## Exercise 12.4

1. Prove by contradiction that there are no positive integer solutions to $x^{2}-y^{2}=1$.
(Hint: Assume that $x$ and $y$ are both positive integers and use the difference of two squares.)
2. Prove by contradiction that if $a$ is a rational number and $b$ an irrational number, then $a+b$ is an irrational number.
3. Prove by contradiction that there are no positive integer solutions to $x^{2}-y^{2}=10$. (Hint: Assume that $x$ and $y$ are both positive integers and use the difference of two squares.)
4. Prove that if $a$ divides $b$, and $b$ divides $c$, then $a$ divides $c$.
5. Prove that if $a$ divides $b$, and $a$ divides $c$, then $a$ divides $(b+c)$.
6. If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, prove that $a^{2}+b^{2} \geqslant 2 a b$. (Abstract inequality proof.)
7. Prove that the sum of two rational numbers is a rational number.
8. Prove that the sum of two odd numbers is always even.

## Section 12.5 Proofs of abstract inequalities

If $a>0$ and $b>0$, then $\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{a} \geqslant 2$ is an example of an abstract inequality (see Example 2).
To prove that an inequality statement is true, we will use two important facts:
(i) $(\text { Any real number })^{2} \geqslant 0$
(ii) $-(\text { Any real number })^{2} \leqslant 0$.

If both sides of an inequality are squared, the inequality sign is retained only if both sides of the inequality are positive.
For example, $4>3 \Rightarrow 4^{2}>3^{2}$, i.e. $16>9$.
However, if one or both sides are negative,

If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, then

$$
\begin{gathered}
a^{2} \geqslant 0 \text { and } b^{2} \geqslant 0 \\
(a+b)^{2} \geqslant 0 \\
(a-b)^{2} \geqslant 0 \\
-(a+b)^{2} \leqslant 0 \\
-(a-b)^{2} \leqslant 0
\end{gathered}
$$ then this does not hold.

E.g. $\quad 2>-3 \nRightarrow 2^{2}>(-3)^{2}$, i.e. $4 \ngtr 9$.

To prove an abstract inequality;

1. Write down the statement you are asked to prove.
2. Use the rules of inequalities to adapt the inequality until ...
3. you arrive at an inequality that is obviously true.

## Example 1

Prove that $a^{2}+b^{2} \geqslant 2 a b$ for all $a, b \in R$.
If: $a^{2}+b^{2} \geqslant 2 a b$,
then $a^{2}-2 a b+b^{2} \geqslant 0 \ldots$ subtracting $2 a b$ from both sides.
$\therefore(a-b)^{2} \geqslant 0 \ldots$ factorising the left-hand side.
which is always true. $\quad \therefore a^{2}+b^{2} \geqslant 2 a b$.

## Example 2

If $a>0$ and $b>0$, prove that $\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{a} \geqslant 2$.
If: $\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{a} \geqslant 2$,
then $a^{2}+b^{2} \geqslant 2 a b \ldots$ multiply each term by the common denominator $a b$.
$\therefore \quad a^{2}-2 a b+b^{2} \geqslant 0$
$\therefore \quad(a-b)^{2} \geqslant 0 \ldots$ which is always true.

$$
\therefore \quad \frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{a} \geqslant 2 .
$$

## Example 3

Show that $x^{2}+4 x+6>0$ (i.e. is positive) for all $x \in R$.
If: $x^{2}+4 x+6>0$,
then $x^{2}+4 x+4-4+6>0 \quad \ldots$ adding and subtracting $\left(\frac{4}{2}\right)^{2}$ to complete the square.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow(x+2)^{2}-4+6>0 \quad \ldots \text { completing the square. } \\
& \quad \Rightarrow \quad(x+2)^{2}+2>0 \quad \ldots \text { which is true for all values of } x, \text { since }(x+2)^{2}>0 \\
& \quad \text { for all values of } x . \\
& \quad \therefore \quad x^{2}+4 x+6>0 \text { for all } x \in R .
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 4

Show for all real numbers $a, b>0$ that $(a+b)\left(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}\right) \geqslant 4$.
If: $(a+b)\left(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}\right) \geqslant 4$,
then $(a+b)\left(\frac{a+b}{a b}\right) \geqslant 4 \ldots$ using the common denominator $a b$ to add the fractions.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad \frac{(a+b)^{2}}{a b} & \geqslant 4 \ldots \text { simplifying. } \\
\therefore \quad(a+b)^{2} & \geqslant 4 a b \ldots \text { multiplying both sides by } a b . \\
\therefore \quad a^{2}+2 a b+b^{2} & \geqslant 4 a b \ldots \text { expanding the left-hand side. } \\
\therefore \quad a^{2}-2 a b+b^{2} & \geqslant 0 \ldots \text { subtracting } 4 a b \text { from both sides. } \\
\therefore \quad & \therefore \quad(a-b)^{2}
\end{aligned} \geqslant 0 \ldots \text { which is true for all } a, b \in R .
$$

## Section 12.6 Indices

When a number is multiplied by itself many times, we use the index form to represent the product.
$4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4=4^{5}$, i.e. 4 to the power of 5 .
In this case, 5 is the index (plural indices) and 4 is the base number.

## Revision of the rules of indices.

|  | Example | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | $6^{3} \times 6^{4}=6^{7}$ | $a^{p} a^{q}=a^{p+q}$ |
| 2. | $\frac{4^{5}}{4^{2}}=4^{3}$, also $\frac{4^{5}}{4^{7}}=4^{-2}$ | $\frac{a^{p}}{a^{q}}=a^{p-q}$ |
| 3. | $\left(2^{4}\right)^{3}=2^{12}$ | $\left(a^{p}\right)^{q}=a^{p q}$ |
| 4. | $3^{0}=5^{0}=9^{0}=(-3)^{0}=\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{0}=1$ | $a^{0}=1$ |
| 5. | $3^{-1}=\frac{1}{3}, 3^{-4}=\frac{1}{3^{4}}$ | $a^{-p}=\frac{1}{a^{p}}$ |
| 6. | $7^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt[2]{7}, 5^{\frac{1}{3}}=\sqrt[3]{5}$ | $a^{\frac{1}{q}}=\sqrt[q]{a}$ |
| 7. | $8^{\frac{2}{3}}=\left(8^{\frac{1}{3}}\right)^{2}$ or $\left(8^{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$ | $a^{\frac{p}{q}}=\sqrt[q]{a^{p}}=(\sqrt[q]{a})^{p}$ |
| 8. | $\begin{aligned} & (2 \times 5)^{2}=2^{2} \times 5^{2} \\ & \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{4}=\frac{5^{4}}{6^{4}} \end{aligned}$ | $\begin{aligned} & (a b)^{p}=a^{p} a^{p} \\ & \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{p}=\frac{a^{p}}{b^{p}} \end{aligned}$ |

Each of these rules can be verified by expanding the powers and simplifying, e.g.

$$
\left(2^{4}\right)^{3}=2^{4} \times 2^{4} \times 2^{4}=2^{12}=4096
$$

Note: $\sqrt{x}=\sqrt[2]{x}=x^{\frac{1}{2}}=$ the square root of $x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sqrt[3]{x}=x^{\frac{1}{3}}=\text { the cube root of } x \\
& \sqrt[4]{x}=x^{\frac{1}{4}}=\text { the fourth root of } x \ldots \text { etc. }
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: $25^{\frac{3}{2}}=\left(25^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^{3}=(5)^{3}=125$ (most often, it is easier to get the root first and then raise to the power.)

## Example 1

Evaluate each of the following.
(i) $27^{\frac{1}{3}}$
(ii) $36^{\frac{3}{2}}$
(iii) $64^{-\frac{2}{3}}$
(iv) $\left(\frac{27}{125}\right)^{-\frac{2}{3}}$
(i) $27^{\frac{1}{3}}=\sqrt[3]{27}=3 \ldots$ (i.e. 3 multiplied by itself three times equals 27 )
(ii) $36^{\frac{3}{2}}=\left(36^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^{3}=(\sqrt{36})^{3}=6^{3}=216$
(iii) $64^{-\frac{2}{3}}=\frac{1}{64^{\frac{2}{3}}}=\frac{1}{\left(64^{\frac{1}{3}}\right)^{2}}=\frac{1}{(4)^{2}}=\frac{1}{16}$
(iv) $\left(\frac{27}{125}\right)^{-\frac{2}{3}}=\left(\frac{125}{27}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}=\left[\left(\frac{125}{27}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}\right]^{2}=\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^{2}=\frac{25}{9}$

Numerical expressions containing complex fractions with indices can be simplified and evaluated with a calculator.

Since the procedure on each calculator may be slightly different, it is important to gain practice on your calculator, particularly when dealing with fractional powers.

However, it is most important to understand the rules of indices and to be able to apply them to general problems containing unknowns.

(ii) $\frac{\sqrt{a^{3}}}{\sqrt[4]{a} \times \sqrt[3]{a^{2}}}=\frac{a^{\frac{3}{2}}}{a^{\frac{1}{4}} \times a^{\frac{2}{3}}}=\frac{a^{\frac{3}{2}}}{a^{\frac{3+8}{12}}}=\frac{a^{\frac{3}{2}}}{a^{\frac{11}{12}}}=a^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{11}{12}}=a^{\frac{7}{12}}$

## Example 3

Show that $\frac{5^{n+1}-4.5^{n}}{5^{n-2}+5^{n}}=\frac{25}{26}$.
$\frac{5^{n+1}-4.5^{n}}{5^{n-2}+5^{n}}=\frac{5^{n} \cdot 5^{1}-4.5^{n}}{5^{n} \cdot 5^{-2}+5^{n}}=\frac{5.5^{n}-4.5^{n}}{\frac{5^{n}}{25}+5^{n}}=\frac{5^{n}}{\frac{5^{n}+25.5^{n}}{25}}=\frac{5^{n}}{\frac{26.5^{n}}{25}}=\frac{25}{26}$

A=4 \pi r^{2} \text { and its volume } V \text { by } \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}, \text { where } r \text { is the radius of the sphere. }
$$

Show that if we have two spheres of radii $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ respectively, then the ratio of the surface areas can be written as $\frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}=\left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}$.

If two such spheres have volumes $162 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ and $384 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ respectively, find the ratio of their
areas, expressing your answer in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b \in N$.
13. Given $f(n)=3^{n}$, find expressions for
(i) $f(n+3)$
(ii) $f(n+1)$.

Hence find the value of $k$ such that $f(n+3)-f(n+1)=k f(n)$, where $k \in N$.
14. Given $f(n)=3^{n-1}$, find the value of $k$ such that $f(n+3)+f(n)=k f(n)$, where $k \in N$.

## Section 12.7 Exponential equations

$\qquad$
$y=3^{x}$ is an example of an exponential function.
$3^{x}=27$ is an example of an exponential equation.
As in the last section, 3 is the base number and $x$ is the index (power) or exponent.
When solving exponential equations, it is important to identify the base number (usually a prime number) that is common to all the individual terms of the equation.
E.g. $3^{x}=27$; 3 is the base number for both sides. ... $\left(3^{x}=3^{3}\right)$
$25^{x}=125 ; 5$ is the base number. ... $\left(5^{x}=5^{3}\right)$

## Example 1

Solve these equations. (i) $\frac{1}{8^{x}}=16^{\frac{1}{3}} \quad$ (ii) $27^{x-3}=3 \times 9^{x-2}$
(i) $\frac{1}{8^{x}}=16^{\frac{1}{3}}$ (the base number is 2)
(ii) $27^{x-3}=3 \times 9^{x-2}$
(the base number is 3 )

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{\left(2^{3}\right)^{x}}=\left(2^{4}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \\
& \begin{aligned}
2^{-3 x}=2^{\frac{4}{3}} & \Rightarrow-3 x=\frac{4}{3} \\
& \Rightarrow x=-\frac{4}{9}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(3^{3}\right)^{x-3} & =3 \times\left(3^{2}\right)^{x-2} \\
\Rightarrow 3^{3 x-9} & =3^{1} \times 3^{2 x-4} \\
\Rightarrow 3^{3 x-9} & =3^{2 x-3} \\
\Rightarrow 3 x-9 & =2 x-3 \\
\Rightarrow x & =6
\end{aligned}
$$

By using a suitable change of variable, an exponential equation can be transformed into a

Note: If $2^{x}=y$, quadratic equation and then solved.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow 3 \cdot 2^{x}=3 y \\
& \Rightarrow 2^{2 x}=\left(2^{x}\right)^{2}=y^{2} \\
& \Rightarrow 2^{x+2}=2^{x} \cdot 2^{2}=4 y
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

If $y=3^{x}$, express $3^{2 x}$ in terms of $y$.
Hence solve the equation $3^{2 x}-4.3^{x}+3=0$.
(i) $3^{2 x}=\left(3^{x}\right)^{2}=y^{2}$
(ii) Given $3^{2 x}-4.3^{x}+3=0$.
$\Rightarrow y^{2}-4 y+3=0 \ldots$ using the substitution $3^{x}=y$ and $3^{2 x}=y^{2}$
$\Rightarrow(y-1)(y-3)=0$
$\Rightarrow y=1$ or $y=3 \ldots$ are the solutions of the new quadratic equation
$\Rightarrow 3^{x}=1$ or $3^{x}=3 \ldots$ re-substituting to find values of $x$
$\Rightarrow 3^{x}=3^{0}$ or $3^{x}=3^{1} \ldots$ using the base number 3
$\therefore x=0$ or $x=1$ are the solutions.

(ii) $25^{x}=\frac{125}{\sqrt{5}}$
(iii) $\frac{1}{8^{x}}=\sqrt{2}$
(iv) $7^{x}=\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{7}}$
4. Write $\sqrt{32}$ as a power of 2 and hence solve the equation $16^{x-1}=2 \sqrt{32}$.
5. If $27^{x}=9$ and $2^{x-y}=64$, find the values of $x$ and $y$.
6. Express (i) $2^{x+2}$ and (ii) $2^{x}+2^{x}$ in the form $k 2^{x}$, where $k \in N$.

Hence solve for $c$ in the equation $2^{x}+2^{x}=2^{x+2}(c-2)$.
7. By letting $3^{x}=y$, solve the equation $3^{2 x}-12\left(3^{x}\right)+27=0$.
8. Solve the equation $2^{2 x}-3\left(2^{x}\right)-4=0$ and verify your answer by substitution.
9. Solve each of these equations: (i) $2^{2 x}-9\left(2^{x}\right)+8=0$ (ii) $3^{2 x}-10\left(3^{x}\right)+9=0$
10. If $y=2^{x}$, write (i) $2^{2 x}$ (ii) $2^{2 x+1}$ and (iii) $2^{x+3}$ in terms of $y$.

Hence solve the equation $2^{2 x+1}-2^{x+3}-2^{x}+4=0$.

15. Solve the exponential equation $3^{x}+81\left(3^{-x}\right)-30=0$.

## Section 12.8 Exponential functions

Exponential functions such as $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{a}^{\boldsymbol{x}}$ are used in modelling many physical occurrences.
These include:
(i) the growth of a biological cell
(ii) changes in population, e.g. algae growth on stagnant water
(iii) compounded interest and depreciation
(iv) radioactive decay
(v) the rate at which a body loses heat (Newton's law of cooling).

ICT: Functions of the form $y=a^{x}, a=$ constant, can be studied graphically. Remember, when using a keyboard, to use the "^" button to raise a power (exponent), i.e. $y=2^{\wedge} x$.
Proper use of brackets is essential, i.e. $y=2^{\wedge}(2 x)=2^{2 x}$.

All of the graphs associated with exponential functions have a characteristic shape and are easily identified. From this diagram we can see that graphs of the form $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{a}^{\boldsymbol{x}}$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, have the following properties;

1. At $x=0, f(0)=a^{0}=1$.
$\Rightarrow(0,1)$ is a point on all graphs.
2. At $x=1, f(1)=a^{1}=a$.
$\Rightarrow(1, a)$ is a point on all graphs.
3. At $x=-1, f(-1)=a^{-1}=\frac{1}{a}$.
$\Rightarrow\left(-1, \frac{1}{a}\right)$ is a point on all graphs.

4. They are defined for all real values of $x$.
5. The $x$-axis is a horizontal asymptote to all the curves $\Rightarrow f(x)=a^{x}$ is always positive.
6. If $\boldsymbol{a}>\mathbf{1}$, all of the curves increase as $x$ increases. As $a$ increases, the curves rise more steeply.
7. If $\mathbf{0}<\boldsymbol{a}<\mathbf{1}$, then the curve $f(x)=a^{x}$ reflects in the $y$-axis, producing a set of curves that decrease rapidly as $x$ increases.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-485.jpg?height=485&width=600&top_left_y=177&top_left_x=1037)

Note: If $a=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=2^{-1}$

$$
\Rightarrow f(x)=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x}=\left(2^{-1}\right)^{x}=2^{-x}
$$

Note: The general formula for an increasing exponential function is $f(x)=\mathrm{A} a^{x}$, where A is the value at the start, i.e. when $x=0$.

Exponential functions $f(x)=\mathrm{A} \cdot a^{x}$
Increasing exponential functions $a>1$.
Decreasing exponential functions $0<a<1$. $(0, \mathrm{~A})$ is the $y$-axis intercept.
Decreasing functions can be written in the form

$$
f(x)=\mathrm{A} \cdot a^{-x}
$$

## Example 1

A bacterial colony doubles every hour. If 10 bacteria cells were present at the start of an experiment, (i) complete the following table (ii) draw a graph of the number of bacteria present up to 5 hours.

| Time in hours | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Number of bacteria |  |  |  |  |  |  |

(iii) By how many would the population increase in the 6th hour?
(iv) What percentage increase in the population occurred in the 6th hour by comparison to the first hour?
(v) Write an expression for the size of the population (N) after $t$ hours.
(i)

| Time in hours | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Number of bacteria | 10 | 20 | 40 | 80 | 160 | 320 |

(ii)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-486.jpg?height=591&width=508&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=368)
(iii) At $t=5$ hours, there are 320 bacteria.
At $t=6$ hours, there are 640 bacteria.
$\Rightarrow$ an increase of 320 bacteria.
(iv) Percentage increase
$=\left(\frac{320}{10}\right) \times \frac{100}{1} \%$
$=3200 \%$
(v) After $t$ hours, $\mathrm{N}=\mathrm{A} \cdot a^{t}$.

At $t=0, \mathrm{~N}=10=\mathrm{A} \cdot a^{0}$.
$\Rightarrow 10=\mathrm{A}$.
At $t=1, \mathrm{~N}=10 . a^{1}=20$.
$\Rightarrow a=2$.
$\therefore \quad \mathrm{N}=10.2^{t}$.

## Example 2

The graphs of two exponential functions, $y=\mathrm{A} a^{x}$, are given in this diagram. Find the values of A and $a$ for each graph.
(i) $f(x)=\mathrm{A} a^{x}$
$f(0)=1, \therefore \mathrm{~A} a^{0}=1 \Rightarrow \mathrm{~A}=1$.
$f(1)=2, \therefore a^{1}=2 \Rightarrow a=2$
[ $\therefore f(x)$ is an increasing function]
$\therefore f(x)=2^{x}$
(ii) $h(x)=\mathrm{A} a^{x}$
$f(0)=4, \therefore \mathrm{~A} a^{0}=4 \Rightarrow \mathrm{~A}=4$.
$f(1)=2, \therefore 4 a^{1}=2 \Rightarrow a=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-486.jpg?height=402&width=609&top_left_y=1296&top_left_x=924)
[ $\therefore f(x)$ is a decreasing function]
$h(x)=4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x}=4.2^{-x}$

The magnitude (or size) $M$ of an earthquake is measured on a scale called the Richter scale.
During earthquakes, the amplitude $(A)$ of the earth's movement is a measure of the intensity $(I)$ of the quake i.e. $I \sim A$ and is given by the exponential formula $I=k 10^{M}$, where $k$ is a constant.
The energy released by the earthquake of magnitude $M$ is $E=10^{1.5 M+4.4}$ joules

An earthquake of magnitude 2 on the Richter scale releases $25,118,864$ Joules of energy.
An earthquake of magnitude 6 on the Richter scale releases 25,118,864,315,096 Joules of energy.

## Example 3

Given that the intensity of an earthquake is represented by the formula $I=k 10^{M}$, and the energy released during a quake by the formula $\mathrm{E} \cong 10^{1.5 M+4.8}$, where $I$ is the Intensity and $M$ is the magnitude on the Richter scale, compare
(i) the intensity
(ii) the energy of an earthquake of magnitude 6.1 on the Richter scale with a quake of magnitude 4.7.
(i) $M_{1}=6.1 \Rightarrow I_{1}=k 10^{6.1}$
$M_{2}=4.7 \Rightarrow I_{2}=k 10^{4.7}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{I_{1}}{I_{2}}=\frac{k 10^{6.1}}{k 10^{4.7}}=10^{1.4} \cong 25$
$\Rightarrow I_{1} \cong 25 I_{2}$
(ii) $\mathrm{E}_{1} \cong 10^{1.5 M+4.8}=10^{1.5 \times 6.1+4.8}=10^{13.95}$
$\mathrm{E}_{2} \cong 10^{1.5 M+4.8}=10^{1.5 \times 4.7+4.8}=10^{11.85}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{E}_{1}}{\mathrm{E}_{2}}=\frac{10^{13.95}}{10^{11.85}}=10^{2.1} \cong 126$
$\mathrm{E}_{1} \cong 126 \mathrm{E}_{2}$

## Section 12.9 Logarithmic function

The logarithm is a function that focuses on the index (or exponent) of a number.
If $y=2^{5}$, then $y=32$ is easily calculated.
However, if $200=2^{x}$, it is not as easy to find the index $x$ that gives the number 200.
To find $x$, we use logarithms (logs for short).
Consider the result $32=2^{5}$; using $\log$ notation, $\log _{2} 32=5$.
This is read as "the $\log$ of 32 to the base 2 is 5 ", i.e., $\mathbf{5}$ is the index (power) to which the base number 2 must be raised to get 32 .

Similarly, $10^{2}=100$ can be rewritten using logs as $\log _{10} 100=2$ (the $\log$ of 100 in the base 10 is 2 ),
i.e., $\mathbf{2}$ is the index (power) to which the base number 10 must be raised to get 100 .

Thus, the equations $2^{3}=8$ and $\log _{2} 8=3$ are identical and interchangeable.

| Index form | $\log$ form |
| :---: | :--- |
| $32=2^{5}$ | $\log _{2} 32=5$ |
| $100=10^{2}$ | $\log _{10} 100=2$ |
| $200=2^{x}$ | $\log _{2} 200=x$ |

The logarithm of a number is the power to which the base number must be raised to get that number. $\boldsymbol{a}^{\boldsymbol{x}}=\boldsymbol{y}$ is equivalent to $\boldsymbol{\operatorname { l o g }}_{\boldsymbol{a}} \boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{x}$

From this definition of a log, it is clear that
(i) $\log _{5} 25=2$
(ii) $\log _{3} 27=3$
(iii) $\log _{2} 16=4$
(iv) $\log _{3} 81=4$,
i.e. to what power must 5 be raised, to get $25 \ldots$ ? Answer $=2 \ldots$ etc.

If the log or base is not a whole number, proceed as follows.

## Example 1

Without using a calculator, evaluate
(i) $\log _{9} 27$
(ii) $\log _{\frac{1}{3}} 9$
(iii) $\log _{\sqrt{2}} 8$.
(i) Let $\log _{9} 27=x$.
(iii) Let $\log _{\sqrt{2}} 8=x$.
$\Rightarrow 9^{x}=27$

$$
\begin{array}{r}
\Rightarrow(\sqrt{2})^{x}=8 \\
\Rightarrow\left(2^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^{x}=2^{3} \\
\Rightarrow \frac{x}{2}=3 \\
\Rightarrow x=6
\end{array}
$$

$$
\Rightarrow\left(3^{2}\right)^{x}=3^{3}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow 2 x=3 \\
& \Rightarrow x=\frac{3}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## (ii) Let $\log _{\frac{1}{3}} 9=x$. <br> $\Rightarrow\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{x}=9$ <br> $$
\Rightarrow\left(3^{-1}\right)^{x}=3^{2}
$$ <br> $$
\begin{aligned} \Rightarrow-x & =2 \\ \Rightarrow x & =-2 \end{aligned}
$$ <br> (ii) Let $\begin{aligned} \log _{\frac{1}{3}} 9 & =x . \\ \Rightarrow\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{x} & =9\end{aligned}$ <br> $\qquad$

## 1. The laws of logarithms

When the rules of indices are expressed in logarithm form, we produce the very important laws of logarithms.

These laws enable us to solve many complex equations.

Using your calculator, verify each of the following.

1. $\log _{10} 4+\log _{10} 3=\log _{10} 12=1.0792$

## The Laws of Logarithms

1. $\log _{a} x y=\log _{a} x+\log _{a} y$
2. $\log _{a}\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)=\log _{a} x-\log _{a} y$
3. $\log _{a} x^{n}=n \log _{a} x$
4. $\log _{a} a=1$
5. $\log _{a} 1=0$
6. $\log _{a} x=\frac{\log _{b} x}{\log _{b} a}$
7. $\log _{10} 8-\log _{10} 6=\log _{10}\left(\frac{8}{6}\right)=0.1249$
8. $\log _{10} 8^{3}=3 \log _{10} 8=2.7093$
9. $\log _{10} 10=1$
10. $\log _{10} 1=0$

The rules of logs apply to any base, however, the two most widely-used bases in logs are the base 10 and the base e (2.718).

Base ten logs, e.g. $\log _{\mathbf{1 0}} \mathbf{1 0 0 0}$, are used for calculation purposes and are referred to as common logs.

Base $e(=2.718)$, e.g. $\log _{e} 1000$, is used when dealing with naturally-occurring events, e.g. earthquakes, growth of colonies etc., and hence are called natural logs and are written $\boldsymbol{\operatorname { l o g }}_{\boldsymbol{e}} \boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{\operatorname { l n }} \boldsymbol{x}$.

## Example 2

Without using a calculator, simplify the following number:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 \log _{10} 3+\log _{10} 16-2 \log _{10}\left(\frac{6}{5}\right) & \\
2 \log _{10} 3+\log _{10} 16-2 \log _{10}\left(\frac{6}{5}\right) & =\log _{10} 3^{2}+\log _{10} 16-\log _{10}\left(\frac{6}{5}\right)^{2} \\
& =\log _{10}\left(3^{2} \times 16\right)-\log _{10}\left(\frac{36}{25}\right) \\
& =\log _{10} \frac{9 \times 16}{\left(\frac{36}{25}\right)} \\
& =\log _{10} 100=2
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

Without using a calculator, simplify the following number:

$$
\log _{2} 128+\log _{3} 45-\log _{3} 5
$$

$\log _{2} 128+\log _{3} 45-\log _{3} 5=\log _{2} 128+\log _{3}\left(\frac{45}{5}\right)=\log _{2} 128+\log _{3} 9$
(Since the bases are different, these logs cannot be added!)
Let $\log _{2} 128=x \Rightarrow 128=2^{x}$ also, let $\log _{3} 9=y \Rightarrow 9=3^{y}$
$2^{7}=2^{x}$
$3^{2}=3^{y}$
$7=x$
$2=y$
$\therefore \quad \log _{2} 128+\log _{3} 9=7+2=9$

## Example 4

Evaluate the following number correct to two significant figures:

$$
\log _{8} 11-\log _{6} 4
$$

Using the log key on the calculator
Press ${ }_{\text {logal }}, 8, \rightarrow, 11, \rightarrow,-,{ }_{\text {log }-1}, 6, \rightarrow, 4, \rightarrow,=$ $\rightarrow$ is the forward key on the cursor button.
$=0.379438$
$=0.38$ correct to two significant figures.

Note: For all bases,
(i) if $\log _{\mathrm{e}}(\mathrm{e})^{k}=x \quad$ also
(ii) if $a^{\left(\log _{a} n\right)}=x$
$\Rightarrow k \log _{\mathrm{e}}(\mathrm{e})=x$
$\Rightarrow \log _{a} a^{\left(\log _{a} n\right)}=\log _{a} x \ldots$ taking the $\log$ of both sides.
but $\log _{\mathrm{e}}(\mathrm{e})=1$
$\Rightarrow k=x$

The log of a number to its own base is 1 .
$\therefore \quad \log _{a} n \cdot \log _{a} a=\log _{a} x$
$\therefore \log _{a} n .1=\log _{a} x$
$\Rightarrow n=x$

If $e$ is a positive integer, $\mathrm{e} \geqslant 2, k>0 \quad$ (i) $\log _{\mathrm{e}}(\mathrm{e})^{k}=k$ and (ii) $e^{\left(\log _{\mathrm{e}} k\right)}=k$

## 2. Solving logarithmic equations

- When solving log equations, always check that each term has the same base. If this is not the case, the change of base rule must first be used to change to a common base.
- If no base is given, the equation holds true for all bases.
- If $\log _{a} b=\log _{a} c$, then $b=c$.
- If $\log _{a} b=k$, then $b=a^{k}$.
- Check all solutions to make sure they do not produce logs of negative numbers as these are not defined. (See page 492.)


## Example 5

Solve the equation $2 \log _{3} x-\log _{3}(18-x)=1$.
$2 \log _{3} x-\log _{3}(18-x)=1$
$\Rightarrow \log _{3} x^{2}-\log _{3}(18-x)=1$
$\Rightarrow \log _{3}\left(\frac{x^{2}}{18-x}\right)=1$
$\Rightarrow\left(\frac{x^{2}}{18-x}\right)=3^{1}=3$
$\Rightarrow x^{2}=54-3 x$
$\Rightarrow x^{2}+3 x-54=0$
$\Rightarrow(x-6)(x+9)=0$
$\Rightarrow x=6$ or $x=-9$.

If $x=-9$, the equation becomes

$$
2 \log _{3}(-9)-\log _{3}(18+9)=1
$$

Since the $\log _{3}(-9)$ is undefined, $x=-9$ is rejected as an answer.
$\Rightarrow x=6$.

## Example 6

Solve the equation $\log _{3} x+3 \log _{x} 3=4$.
This equation contains logs with different bases.
Therefore, we need to change base 3 to base $x$ (or vice versa).
$\log _{3} x=\frac{\log _{x} x}{\log _{x} 3}=\frac{1}{\log _{x} 3}$ because $\log _{x} x=1$
$\therefore \log _{3} x+3 \log _{x} 3=4 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{\log _{x} 3}+3 \log _{x} 3=4$
Using the substitution $\log _{x} 3=y$,

$$
\begin{array}{l|l}
\quad \frac{1}{y}+3 y=4 & \therefore \log _{x} 3=1 \Rightarrow 3=x^{1} \\
\Rightarrow 1+3 y^{2}=4 y & \Rightarrow 3=x \\
3 y^{2}-4 y+1=0 & \text { or } \log _{x} 3=\frac{1}{3}
\end{array} \Rightarrow 3=x^{\frac{1}{3}}=\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow 3^{3}=x \\
& (3 y-1)(y-1)=0 \\
& \therefore \quad y=1 \text { or } y=\frac{1}{3}
\end{aligned} \quad \begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow 27=x
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad x=3$ or 27 (both solutions give positive logs and thus are acceptable).
(Note: This result can be verified by repeating the procedure using the base 3 instead of the base $\left.x: \log _{x} 3=\frac{\log _{3} 3}{\log _{3} x}=\frac{1}{\log _{3} x}\right)$.

## Section 12.10 The graph of $y=\log _{a}(x)$

Using computer software, the graphs of $\log _{10}(x), \log _{e}(x)$ [i.e. $\ln (x)$ ] and $\log _{2}(x)$ are drawn in the domain $0 \leqslant x \leqslant 10$.
Comparing the graphs, we conclude that $y=\log _{a}(x)$ has the following properties:

1. $\log _{\text {(any base) }} 1=0$.
2. $\log _{2} 2=\log _{\mathrm{e}} \mathrm{e}=\log _{10} 10=1$.
3. All graphs of log functions are increasing.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-495.jpg?height=451&width=772&top_left_y=1033&top_left_x=859)
4. $y=\log _{a}(x)$ is defined for $\boldsymbol{x}>\mathbf{0}$ only.
5. $y=\log _{a}(0)$ is not defined.
6. The $y$-axis is a vertical asymptote to all curves.

## Comparing $\log _{a}(x)$ with $y=a^{x}$

If we let $a=2$; comparing $y=2^{x}$ and $y=\log _{2}(x)$, we have

| $\boldsymbol{x}$ | $\boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{2}^{\boldsymbol{x}}$ | $\boldsymbol{x}$ | $\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{\operatorname { l o g }}_{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{x}$ |
| :---: | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| 0 | $y=2^{0}=1$ | 1 | $y=\log _{2} 1=0$ |
| 1 | $y=2^{1}=2$ | 2 | $y=\log _{2} 2=1$ |
| 2 | $y=2^{2}=4$ | 4 | $y=\log _{2} 4=2$ |
| 3 | $y=2^{3}=8$ | 8 | $y=\log _{2} 8=3$ |
| 4 | $y=2^{4}=16$ | 16 | $y=\log _{2} 16=4$ |

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_25efca13633dab4f44f5g-495.jpg?height=409&width=635&top_left_y=1766&top_left_x=993)

The points $(0,1),(1,2),(2,4),(3,8),(4,16), \ldots$ are on the curve $y=2^{x}$.
The points $(1,0),(2,1),(4,2),(8,3),(16,4), \ldots$ are on the curve $y=\log _{2}(x)$.
$\therefore \quad y=\log _{2}(x)$ is the inverse function of $y=2^{x}$.
Also, $y=\log _{10} x$ is the inverse function of $y=10^{x}$.
The graphs of $y=2^{x}$ and $y=\log _{2}(x)$ reflect in the line $x=y$.

## Section 12.11 Problem-solving with exponential and log functions

As stated already, exponential and log functions are used to model a wide variety of problems.
The loudness of sounds, the acidity of a solution and the intensity of earthquakes on the Richter scale are some examples, among many, of their application.

## Example 1

The acidity of a substance is determined by the ion concentration formula $\mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$, where a pH of 7 is defined as neutral, $<7$ acidic, $>7$ alkaline. Determine the acidity of each of the following substances.
(a) Apple juice with a $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$ion concentration of 0.0003 .
(b) Ammonia with a $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$ion concentration of $1.3 \times 10^{-9}$.
(a) $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=0.0003 \Rightarrow \mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =-\log [0.0003] \\
& =3.52 \quad \therefore \quad \text { the apple juice is acidic }
\end{aligned}
$$

(b) $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.3 \times 10^{-9} \Rightarrow \mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =-\log \left[1.3 \times 10^{-9}\right] \\
& =8.87 \quad \therefore \quad \text { the ammonia solution is alkaline }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

The loudness of a sound of intensity $I$ is given by the formula $\mathrm{dB}=10 \log \left(\frac{I}{I_{\mathrm{o}}}\right)$, where dB is measured in decibels and $I_{\mathrm{o}}$ is the threshold intensity of hearing ( $I_{\mathrm{o}}=1 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{Wm}^{-2}$ ).
(a) Find the loudness (in decibels) of a sound at the threshold of hearing.
(b) Given that prolonged exposure to sounds over 85 decibels can cause hearing damage, and that a gunshot from a .22 rifle has an intensity of $I=2.5 \times 10^{13} I_{\mathrm{o}}$, should you wear ear protection when firing this gun?
(a) Threshold of hearing $=1 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{Wm}^{-2}$
$\mathrm{dB}=10 \log \left(\frac{I}{I_{\mathrm{o}}}\right)=10 \log \left(\frac{1 \times 10^{-12}}{1 \times 10^{-12}}\right)=10 \log 1=0 \mathrm{~dB}$, i.e. no loudness.
(b) $I=2.5 \times 10^{13} I_{\mathrm{o}}$
$\mathrm{dB}=10 \log \left(\frac{I}{I_{\mathrm{o}}}\right)=10 \log \frac{2.5 \times 10^{13} I_{\mathrm{o}}}{I_{\mathrm{o}}}=10 \log 2.5 \times 10^{13}=134 \mathrm{~dB}$.
Yes, since the loudness is well above 85 dB , you should wear ear protection.

## Compound interest (increasing value)

The final value, €A, of a sum of money, € P , invested at a rate of $i$ (expressed in decimal form) compound interest for $t$ years, is given by the formula $\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{t}$. It is often required that we calculate the time, $t$ (the index), for a particular investment to mature. This can be done by using logs as follows;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { If } \quad \mathrm{A}=\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{t}, \\
& \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\mathrm{~A}}{\mathrm{P}}=(1+i)^{t} \ldots \text { dividing both sides by } \mathrm{P} \\
& \Rightarrow \ln \left(\frac{\mathrm{~A}}{\mathrm{P}}\right)=\ln (1+i)^{t} \ldots \text { taking the natural } \log \text { of both sides } \\
& \Rightarrow \ln \left(\frac{\mathrm{A}}{\mathrm{P}}\right)=t \cdot \ln (1+i) \ldots \ln ^{n}=n \cdot \ln \mathrm{~B} \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{\ln \left(\frac{\mathrm{~A}}{\mathrm{P}}\right)}{\ln (1+i)}=t
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

How long would it take $€ 5000$ to increase in value to €6000, if invested in a credit union at a yearly compound interest rate of $2 \%$ ?

Since $\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{t}$, where $€ \mathrm{P}$ is invested for $t$ years at $i \%$,

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}
\mathrm{A}=€ 6000 & \quad \mathrm{P}=€ 5000 & i=2 \%=0.02 \quad \therefore \quad 1+i=1.02 \\
\Rightarrow € 6000 & =€ 5000(1.02)^{t} & \quad \text { Method } 2 \\
\frac{6000}{5000} & =(1.02)^{t} & \quad \begin{aligned}
1.2=(1.02)^{t} & \\
1.2 & =(1.02)^{t}
\end{aligned} \\
\ln 1.2 & =\ln (1.02)^{t} \quad \ldots \quad \log _{(1.02)} 1.2=t \\
\ln 1.2 & =t . \ln 1.02 & \Rightarrow t=9.2069=9.21 \text { years. } \\
\frac{\ln 1.2}{\ln 1.02} & =t & \\
9.21 \text { years } & =t \cong 9 \text { years and } 77 \text { days } &
\end{array}
$$

## Depreciation (reducing value)

If a quantity reduces by a fixed amount over a given term (e.g. per annum), the same equation can be adapted to track the reducing value over time.

The present population P then becomes $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{P}_{0}(1-i)^{t}$ where $\mathrm{P}_{0}$ was the initial population.
For example, if the population of red squirrels is reducing at a rate of $5 \%$ per year, then $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{P}_{0}(1-0.05)^{t}=\mathrm{P}_{0}(0.95)^{t}$ is the number of red squirrels after " $t$ " years.

## Example 4

The population of red squirrels in a given region was estimated to be 5000 at the start of 2003. Assuming a rate of decrease of $5 \%$ per year, estimate the size of the population in 2013.

Since $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{P}_{0}(1-i)^{t}$ and $i=5 \%=0.05$, and given that $\mathrm{P}_{0}=5000$ and $t=10$ years,
$\therefore \quad P=5000(1-0.05)^{10}=5000(0.95)^{10}=2994$ squirrels

## Doubling time

The doubling time is the time required for a quantity to double in size or value.
If a quantity is growing exponentially, then the number (or value) present at time $t$ can be expressed by $y=A . e^{b t}$, where $A$ is the amount or value at the start (i.e. $t=0$ ) and $b$ is a growth constant, specific to a particular organism.

If this quantity doubles in size, then there are $2 A$ present.
$\therefore \quad 2 A=A e^{b T}$, where $T$ is the time taken to produce $2 A$, i.e. the doubling time.
$\therefore \quad 2=e^{b T}$
$\therefore \quad \ln 2=\ln e^{b T}=b T \ln e=b T$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\ln 2}{b}=T$, the doubling time.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \qquad \ln x^{n}=n \cdot \ln x \\
& \text { and } \ln e=1
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 5

A certain type of bacteria is growing exponentially, where $y=\mathrm{A} e^{b t}$ is the number of bacteria present after $t$ (hours) and $b$ is the growth constant. Under certain conditions, the bacteria doubles in population every 6.5 hours. If at the start of the experiment under these conditions there are 100 bacteria present, find (i) the growth constant $b$ (ii) how many bacteria will be present after 2 days.

Since $y=\mathrm{A} e^{b t}$, then $200=100 e^{6.5 b} \ldots$ since 100 doubles to 200 in 6.5 hours

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad 2 & =e^{6.5 b} \\
\therefore \quad \ln 2 & =\ln e^{6.5 b}=6.5 b \ln e=6.5 b
\end{aligned}
$$

(i) The growth constant $b=\frac{\ln 2}{6.5}=0.1066$ per hour.
(ii) Two days $=48$ hours

The number present after 48 hours $=100 e^{0.1066 \times 48}$

$$
=16680 \text { bacteria. }
$$

## Exercise 12.11

1. Anne invests $€ 5000$ in a fixed-term account paying $0.6 \%$ per month compound interest. Find
(i) the money in Anne's account after
(a) 1 month
(b) 2 months
(c) 3 months
(ii) a formula for the amount Anne has saved after $t$-months
(iii) the minimum time for which Anne needs to invest her money if she wants to double her money.
2. A biologist puts 100 bacteria into a controlled environment at the start of an experiment.
Six hours later, she returns and counts 450 bacteria in the colony.
Assuming exponential growth of the form $y=\mathrm{A} e^{b t}$ where $b$ is the growth constant, find a value for $b$, correct to two decimal places.

## Section 12.12 Proofs by induction

Many theorems in mathematics are proven true using the method of mathematical induction.
To prove a statement true by induction, we follow clearly-defined steps.
(i) The statement is proven true for some fixed value, usually $n=1$ or $n=2$.
(ii) The statement is then assumed true for $n=k$.
(iii) Based on this assumption, we must show that the statement is true for $n=k+1$.
(iv) In conclusion, a "rolling proof" is formed:
a. Since it was true for $n=1$,
b. it is now true for $n=1+1=2$.
c. Since it is true for $n=2$, it is true for $n=2+1=3$, etc.
d. It is therefore true for all values of $n$.

## Example 1

Prove that for all values of $\boldsymbol{n}, 1+2+3+4+\ldots n=\frac{n}{2}(n+1)$.

## Proof:

(i) Prove the statement true for $n=1$.

$$
\Rightarrow 1=\frac{1}{2}(1+1)=\frac{1}{2}(2)=1, \text { which is true. }
$$

(ii) Assume true for $n=k$.

$$
\Rightarrow 1+2+3+4+\ldots k=\frac{k}{2}(k+1) .
$$

(iii) Based on this assumption, we must show that the statement is true for $n=k+1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
1+2+3+4+\ldots k+(\boldsymbol{k}+\mathbf{1}) & =\frac{k}{2}(k+1)+(\boldsymbol{k}+\mathbf{1}) \ldots \text { adding }(k+1) \text { to } \\
& =(k+1)\left(\frac{k}{2}+1\right) \ldots \text { factorising }(k+1) \\
& =(k+1)\left(\frac{k+2}{2}\right) \ldots \text { getting a common } \\
& =\left(\frac{k+1}{2}\right)(k+2) \ldots \text { re-arranging the } \\
& =\left(\frac{k+1}{2}\right)[(k+1)+1]
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad$ It is true for $n=k+1$.
(iv) But since it is true for $n=1$, it now must be true for $n=1+1=2$.

And if it is true for $n=2$, it is true for $n=2+1=3 \ldots$ etc.
(v) Therefore, it is true for all values of $n$.

Note 1: Although we could prove this statement true for many discrete values of $n$, the important feature of this method of proof is that it proves the statement true for all values of $\boldsymbol{n}$.

Note 2: Mathematical induction is not a means of discovering a result, but when we have a result that seems to be true, this method provides us with a rigorous proof.

Note 3: Proof by induction can be applied to several different categories of results including;
(i) Results involving series of numbers e.g. $1+2+3+4+\ldots . n=\frac{n}{2}(n+1)$.
(ii) Results involving factors of expressions
e.g. $10^{n}-7^{n}$ is divisible by 3 .
(iii) Results involving inequalities
e.g. $3^{n}>3 n+1$, for $n \geqslant 2$.

## Example 2

Prove that for all values of $n \in N, 3+3^{2}+3^{3}+3^{4}+3^{5}+\ldots .3^{n}=\frac{3}{2}\left(3^{n}-1\right)$.

## Proof:

(i) Prove the statement true for $n=1$.

$$
3^{1}=\frac{3}{2}\left(3^{1}-1\right)=\frac{3}{2}(2)=3 \ldots \text { which is true. }
$$

(ii) Assume true for $n=k$.

$$
3+3^{2}+3^{3}+3^{4}+3^{5}+\ldots 3^{k}=\frac{3}{2}\left(3^{k}-1\right)
$$

(iii) Based on this assumption, we must now show that the statement is true for $n=k+1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
3+3^{2}+3^{3}+3^{4}+3^{5}+\ldots 3^{k}+\mathbf{3}^{k+1} & =\frac{3}{2}\left(3^{k}-1\right)+\mathbf{3}^{k+1} \ldots \text { adding } 3^{k+1} \\
& =\frac{3}{2}\left(3^{k}-1\right)+3^{k} \cdot 3^{1} \\
& =3\left(\frac{\left(3^{k}-1\right)}{2}+3^{k}\right) \ldots \text { factorising } 3 . \\
& =3\left(\frac{3^{k}-1+2.3^{k}}{2}\right) \ldots \text { common } \\
& =\frac{3}{2}\left(3.3^{k}-1\right) \ldots \text { rearranging. } \\
& =\frac{3}{2}\left(3^{k+1}-1\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad$ It is true for $n=k+1$.
(iv) But since it is true for $n=1$, it now must be true for $n=1+1=2$.

And if it is true for $n=2$, it is true for $n=2+1=3 \ldots$ etc.
(v) Therefore, it is true for all values of $n$.

## Example 3

Prove by induction that $\frac{1}{1.2}+\frac{1}{2.3}+\frac{1}{3.4}+\ldots \frac{1}{n(n+1)}=\frac{n}{n+1}, n \in N$.

## Proof:

(i) Prove the statement true for $n=1$.

$$
\frac{1}{1(1+1)}=\frac{1}{1+1}=\frac{1}{2} \ldots \text { which is true. }
$$

(ii) Assume true for $n=k$.

$$
\frac{1}{1.2}+\frac{1}{2.3}+\frac{1}{3.4}+\ldots \frac{1}{k(k+1)}=\frac{k}{k+1}, k \in N .
$$

(iii) Based on this assumption, we must now show that the statement is true for $n=k+1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{1.2}+\frac{1}{2.3}+\frac{1}{3.4}+\ldots \frac{1}{k(k+1)}+\frac{\mathbf{1}}{(\boldsymbol{k}+\mathbf{1})(\boldsymbol{k}+\mathbf{2})} & =\frac{k}{k+1}+\frac{\mathbf{1}}{(\boldsymbol{k}+\mathbf{1})(\boldsymbol{k}+\mathbf{2})} \\
& =\frac{k(k+2)+1}{(k+1)(k+2)} \\
& =\frac{k^{2}+2 k+1}{(k+1)(k+2)} \\
=\frac{(k+1)(k+1)}{(k+1)(k+2)} & =\frac{(k+1)}{(k+1)+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad$ It is true for $n=k+1$.
(iv) But since it is true for $n=1$, it now must be true for $n=1+1=2$.

And if it is true for $n=2$, it is true for $n=2+1=3, \ldots$ etc.
(v) Therefore, it is true for all values of $n$.

## Exercise 12.12(A)

1. $2+4+6+8+\ldots .2 n=\sum_{n=1}^{n} 2 n=n(n+1)$.
2. $1+4+7+10+\ldots .(3 n-2)=\frac{n}{2}(3 n-1)$.
3. $1(2)+2(3)+3(4)+4(5)+\ldots n(n+1)=\sum_{n=1}^{n} n(n+1)=\frac{n}{3}(n+1)(n+2)$.
4. $\frac{1}{2(3)}+\frac{1}{3(4)}+\frac{1}{4(5)}+\frac{1}{5(6)}+\ldots \frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)}=\frac{n}{2(n+2)}$.
5. $\frac{1}{4(5)}+\frac{1}{5(6)}+\frac{1}{6(7)}+\frac{1}{7(8)}+\ldots \frac{1}{(n+3)(n+4)}=\sum_{n=1}^{n} \frac{1}{(n+3)(n+4)}=\frac{n}{4(n+4)}$.
6. $1^{3}+2^{3}+3^{3}+4^{3}+\ldots . n^{3}=\sum_{n=1}^{n} n^{3}=\frac{n^{2}}{4}(n+1)^{2}$.
7. $\sum_{n=1}^{n} n(n+2)=\frac{n(n+1)(2 n+7)}{6}$.
8. $x+x^{2}+x^{3}+x^{4}+\ldots . x^{n}=\frac{x\left(x^{n}-1\right)}{x-1}, x \neq 1$.

## Divisibility proofs

## Example 4

Prove that for all $n \in N, 3$ is a factor of $4^{n}-1$.

## Proof:

(i) Prove the statement true for $n=1$.

3 is a factor of $4^{1}-1=3 \ldots$ true.
(ii) Assume true for $n=k$.
$\Rightarrow 3$ is a factor of $4^{k}-1, k \in N$.
(iii) Based on this assumption, we must now show that the statement is true for $n=k+1$.

Is 3 a factor of $4^{k+1}-1$ ?

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =4^{k} \cdot 4^{1}-1 \\
& =4^{k} \cdot(3+1)-1 \\
& =3 \cdot 4^{k}+1 \cdot 4^{k}-1 \\
& =3 \cdot 4^{k}+\left(4^{k}-1\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $3.4^{k}$ is divisible by 3 and ( $4^{k}-1$ ) is assumed divisible by 3 ,
$\therefore \quad 3.4^{k}+\left(4^{k}-1\right)$ is divisible by 3 .
$\therefore \quad$ It is true for $n=k+1$.
(iv) But since it is true for $n=1$, it now must be true for $n=1+1=2$.

And if it is true for $n=2$, it is true for $n=2+1=3, \ldots$ etc.
(v) Therefore, it is true for all values of $n$.

## Example 5

Prove by induction that $8^{n}-7 n+6$ is divisible by 7 for all $n \in N$.

## Proof:

(i) Prove the statement true for $n=1$.

7 is a factor of $8^{1}-7.1+6=7 \ldots$ which is true.
(ii) Assume true for $n=k$.

$$
\Rightarrow 7 \text { is a factor of } 8^{k}-7 k+6, k \in N .
$$

(iii) Based on this assumption, we must now show that the statement is true for $n=k+1$.

Is 7 a factor of $8^{k+1}-7(k+1)+6$ ?

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =8^{k} \cdot 8^{1}-7 k-7+6 \\
& =8^{k} \cdot(7+1)-7 k-7+6 \\
& =7 \cdot 8^{k}+1.8^{k}-7 k-7+6 \\
& =7 \cdot 8^{k}+\left(8^{k}-7 k+6\right)-7
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $7.8^{k}$ is divisible by 7 , ( $8^{k}-7 k+6$ ) is assumed divisible by 7 and -7 is divisible by 7 ,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad 8^{k+1}-7(k+1)+6 \text { is divisible by } 7 . \\
& \therefore \quad \text { It is true for } n=k+1 .
\end{aligned}
$$

(iv) But since it is true for $n=1$, it now must be true for $n=1+1=2$.

And if it is true for $n=2$, it is true for $n=2+1=3, \ldots$ etc.
(v) Therefore, it is true for all values of $n$.

## Example 6

Show that $n(n+1)(n+2)$ is divisible by 3 for $n \in N$.

## Proof:

(i) Prove the statement true for $n=1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
3 \text { is a factor of } n(n+1)(n+2) & =1(1+1)(1+2) \\
& =6 \ldots \text { which is true. }
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) Assume true for $n=k$.

$$
\Rightarrow 3 \text { is a factor of } k(k+1)(k+2), k \in N
$$

(iii) Based on this assumption, we must now show that the statement is true for $n=k+1$.

Is 3 a factor of $(\boldsymbol{k}+\mathbf{1})(\boldsymbol{k}+\mathbf{1}+1)(\boldsymbol{k}+\mathbf{1}+2)$ ?

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =(k+1)(k+2)[k+3] \\
& =(k+1)(k+2) k+(k+1)(k+2) 3 \\
& =k(k+1)(k+2)+3(k+1)(k+2)
\end{aligned}
$$

Since 3 is assumed a factor of $k(k+1)(k+2)$, and 3 is a factor of

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 3(k+1)(k+2) \\
& \therefore \quad(k+1)(k+2)(k+3) \text { is divisible by } 3 . \\
& \therefore \quad \text { It is true for } n=k+1 .
\end{aligned}
$$

(iv) But since it is true for $n=1$, it now must be true for $n=1+1=2$.

And if it is true for $n=2$, it is true for $n=2+1=3, \ldots$ etc.
(v) Therefore, it is true for all values of $n$.

## Exercise 12.12(B)

Prove by induction that

1. $6^{n}-1$ is divisible by 5 for $n \in N$.
2. $5^{n}-1$ is divisible by 4 for $n \in N$.
3. $9^{n}-5^{n}$ is divisible by 4 for $n \in N$.
4. $3^{2 n}-1$ is divisible by 8 for $n \in N$.
5. $7^{n}-2^{n}$ is divisible by 5 for $n \in N$.
6. $7^{2 n+1}+1$ is divisible by 8 for $n \in N$.
7. $2^{3 n-1}+3$ is divisible by 7 for $n \in N$.
8. $5^{n}-4 n+3$ is divisible by 4 for $n \in N$.
9. $7^{n}+4^{n}+1$ is divisible by 6 for $n \in N$.
10. $n(n+1)(2 n+1)$ is divisible by 3 for $n \in N$.
11. $n^{3}-n$ is divisible by 3 for $n \in N$.
12. $13^{n}-6^{n-2}$ is divisible by 7 for $n \geqslant 2, n \in N$.

## Inequality proofs

When dealing with inequalities we noted two important deductions, namely
(i) If $a>b$, then $a-b>0$
(ii) $(\text { any real number })^{2}>0$.

## Example 7

Prove by induction that $2^{n}>n^{2}$ for $n \geqslant 5, n \in N$.

## Proof:

(i) Prove the statement true for $n=5$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2^{5}>5^{2} \\
& 32>25 \ldots \text { which is true. }
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) Assume true for $n=k, k \geqslant 5$.

$$
\Rightarrow 2^{k}>k^{2}, k \in N \text { and } k \geqslant 5 .
$$

(iii) Based on this assumption, we must now show that the statement is true for $n=k+1$.

$$
\text { Is } \quad 2^{k+1}>(k+1)^{2} \text { ? }
$$

Since $2^{k}>k^{2}$ (assumed)

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & 2^{k} \cdot 2>2 k^{2} \\
\therefore & 2^{k+1}>2 k^{2}
\end{array}
$$

$\therefore \quad$ we need to prove that $2 k^{2}>(k+1)^{2}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 k^{2}>k^{2}+2 k+1 \\
& k^{2}-2 k-1>0 \\
& k^{2}-2 k+\mathbf{1}-\mathbf{1}-1>0 \quad \ldots \text { completing the square by adding and } \\
& k^{2}-2 k+1-2>0 \quad \text { subtracting half the coefficient of } k \text { squared. } \\
(k-1)^{2}-2 & >0 \quad \text { which is true for } k \geqslant 5 . \\
\therefore \quad & 2^{k+1}>2 k^{2}>(k+1)^{2} \\
\therefore \quad & \text { It is true for } n=k+1 .
\end{aligned}
$$

(iv) But since it is true for $n=5$, it now must be true for $n=5+1=6$.

And if it is true for $n=6$, it is true for $n=6+1=7$, ... etc.
(v) Therefore, it is true for all values of $n \geqslant 5, n \in N$.

## Example 8

Prove by induction that $n!>2^{n}, n \geqslant 4, n \in N$.

## Proof:

(i) Prove the statement true for $n=4$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
4! & >2^{4} \\
24 & >16 \ldots \text { which is true. }
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) Assume true for $n=k, k \geqslant 4$.

$$
\Rightarrow k!>2^{k}, k \in N \text { and } k \geqslant 4 .
$$

(iii) Based on this assumption, we must now show that the statement is true for $n=k+1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Is }(k+1)!>2^{k+1} \text { ? } \\
& \text { Is }(k+1) k!>2^{k} \cdot 2 \text { ? } \ldots(k+1) k!=(k+1) \text { ! }
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $k!>2^{k}$ (assumed),
$\therefore \quad(k+1) k!>(k+1) 2^{k}$
$\therefore \quad$ we need to prove that $(k+1) 2^{k}>2^{k} .2$
$(k+1) 2^{k}>2.2^{k}$ which is obviously true if $k>1$.

$$
\therefore(k+1)!>2^{k+1}
$$

$\therefore \quad$ It is true for $n=k+1$.
(iv) But since it is true for $n=4$, it now must be true for $n=4+1=5$.

And if it is true for $n=5$, it is true for $n=5+1=6, \ldots$ etc.
(v) Therefore, it is true for all values of $n \geqslant 4, n \in N$.

## Example 9

Prove that $(1+x)^{n} \geqslant 1+n x$ for $n \geqslant 1, n \in N, x \in R$.

## Proof:

(i) Prove the statement true for $n=1$.

$$
\Rightarrow(1+x)^{1} \geqslant 1+1 \cdot x \ldots \text { which is true. }
$$

(ii) Assume true for $n=k, k \geqslant 1$.

$$
(1+x)^{k} \geqslant 1+k x, k \in N \text { and } k \geqslant 1 .
$$

(iii) Based on this assumption, we must now show that the statement is true for $n=k+1$.

$$
\text { Is }(1+x)^{k+1} \geqslant 1+(k+1) x \text { ? }
$$

$$
\text { Is }(1+x)^{k}(1+x) \geqslant 1+k x+x \text { ? }
$$

Since $(1+x)^{k} \geqslant 1+k x \ldots$ (assumed).

$$
\therefore \quad(1+x)^{k}(1+x) \geqslant(1+k x)(1+x)
$$

$\therefore \quad$ we need to prove that $(1+k x)(1+x) \geqslant 1+k x+x$

$$
1+x+k x+k x^{2} \geqslant 1+k x+x
$$

$\Rightarrow k x^{2} \geqslant 0$ which is true for $k \geqslant 1$ and $x \in R$.
$\therefore$ It is true for $n=k+1$.
(iv) But since it is true for $n=1$, it now must be true for $n=1+1=2$.

And if it is true for $n=2$, it is true for $n=2+1=3, \ldots$ etc.
(v) Therefore, it is true for all values of $n \geqslant 1, n \in N$.

## Exercise 12.12(C)

1. $2^{n}>2 n+1$ for $n \geqslant 3, n \in N$.

3. $3^{n}>2 n+2$ for $n \geqslant 2, n \in N$.
4. $n!>2^{n-1}$ for $n \geqslant 3, n \in N$.
5. $(n+1)!>2^{n}$ for $n \geqslant 2, n \in N$.
6. $(1+2 x)^{n} \geqslant 1+2 n x$ for $x>0, n \in N$.
7. $(1+a x)^{n} \geqslant 1+a n x$ for $a>0, x>0, n \in N$.

## Revision Exercise 12 (Extended-Response Questions)

1. The manufacturer of a facial cream SPOTLESS claims that the population of bacteria which create spots will be halved within five days of using their cream. During a trial in his laboratory, Professor Snape finds that the number of bacteria N in the population is given by the formula $\mathrm{N}=5000 e^{-0.15 t}$, where $t$ is time, measured in days.

The diagram shows a conical glass fibre.
The circular cross-sectional area at the end B is $0.02 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$.
The cross-sectional area reduces along the length from B to A by a factor of $(0.92)^{\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)}$ per metre length of the fibre.
The total length of the fibre is 5.0 m .
(i) Write down a rule for the cross-sectional area of the fibre at a distance $x \mathrm{~m}$ from B.
(ii) What is the cross-sectional area of the fibre at a point one-third of its length from $B$ ?

At a distance $x \mathrm{~m}$ from B , the strength of the fibre is given by the formula

$$
\mathrm{S}=(0.92)^{10-3 x} .
