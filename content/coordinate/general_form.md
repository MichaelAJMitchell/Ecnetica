## Circle and Parabola Revision

### Theory
Before studying the general conic form, let's review specific conics:
- Circle: $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$ or $x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$
- Parabola: $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ or $x = ay^2 + by + c$
- These are special cases of the general second-degree equation

### Application
The equation $x^2 + y^2 - 4x + 6y - 12 = 0$ represents a circle with:
- Center: $(2, -3)$
- Radius: $r = \sqrt{4 + 9 + 12} = 5$

## General Form of Second-Degree Equations

### Theory

The general form of a second-degree equation in two variables is:
$$Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$$

where at least one of $A$, $B$, or $C$ is non-zero.

#### Classification by Discriminant
The discriminant $\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$ determines the type of conic:
1. **$\Delta < 0$**: Ellipse (circle if $A = C$ and $B = 0$)
2. **$\Delta = 0$**: Parabola
3. **$\Delta > 0$**: Hyperbola

#### Special Cases
1. **Circle**: $A = C$, $B = 0$, and $\Delta < 0$
2. **Parabola with vertical axis**: $A \neq 0$, $B = C = 0$
3. **Parabola with horizontal axis**: $C \neq 0$, $A = B = 0$
4. **Rectangular hyperbola**: $A = -C$, $B = 0$

#### Degenerate Cases
Sometimes the equation represents:
- A point (when the conic "collapses")
- Two lines (intersecting or parallel)
- No real points (empty set)

### Application

#### Examples

**Example 1: Identifying the Conic**
Identify the conic represented by $4x^2 + 4xy + y^2 - 6x - 8y + 9 = 0$.

**Solution:**
Here $A = 4$, $B = 4$, $C = 1$

Calculate the discriminant:
$\Delta = B^2 - 4AC = 16 - 4(4)(1) = 16 - 16 = 0$

Since $\Delta = 0$, this is a parabola.

**Example 2: Circle to General Form**
Convert the circle $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 16$ to general form.

**Solution:**
Expand:
$(x - 3)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 16$
$x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 + 4y + 4 = 16$
$x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 4y - 3 = 0$

In general form: $A = 1$, $B = 0$, $C = 1$, $D = -6$, $E = 4$, $F = -3$

Verify: $\Delta = 0 - 4(1)(1) = -4 < 0$ and $A = C$, $B = 0$, confirming it's a circle.

**Example 3: Rotating Conic**
The equation $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 - 4 = 0$ represents what type of conic?

**Solution:**
Here $A = 1$, $B = -2$, $C = 1$

$\Delta = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 4 - 4 = 0$

This is a parabola. The presence of the $xy$ term indicates the parabola is rotated.

### Key Takeaways

```{important}
**General Form of Conics - Essential Concepts**

1. **General Equation**: $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$

2. **Classification by Discriminant** $\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$:
   - $\Delta < 0$: Ellipse (circle if $A = C$ and $B = 0$)
   - $\Delta = 0$: Parabola
   - $\Delta > 0$: Hyperbola

3. **Key Properties**:
   - $B \neq 0$ indicates rotation
   - Complete the square to find center and axes
   - Degenerate cases possible (point, lines, empty set)

4. **Applications**: Satellite dishes, planetary orbits, economics, architecture

5. **Remember**: The discriminant quickly identifies the conic type without completing the square
