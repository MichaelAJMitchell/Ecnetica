  Relationships in this cycle:
    • solving absolute value inequalities → solving linear inequalities with rational coefficients
      Reason: Understanding how to solve absolute value inequalities requires knowledge of solving linear inequalities, as the process involves breaking down the absolute value into two separate linear inequalities.
    • solving linear inequalities with rational coefficients → solving absolute value inequalities
      Reason: Knowledge of solving linear inequalities is essential for tackling absolute value inequalities, as the latter often requires applying similar techniques to isolate variables and determine solution sets.

      Reason: Understanding how to simplify surds is essential for effectively isolating and manipulating them in equations, which is a key step in solving algebraic surd equations.
    • simplifying surds by factoring out perfect squares → solving algebraic surd equations by isolating and squaring
      Reason: The ability to simplify surds directly supports the process of isolating them in equations, making it easier to solve algebraic surd equations by squaring both sides.

Cycle 196 (Length 3): Measures of variability: range → Finding quartiles in a data set → Measures of variability: range
  Relationships in this cycle:
    • Measures of variability: range → Finding quartiles in a data set
      Reason: Knowing the range aids in understanding the distribution of data, which is necessary for identifying quartiles and calculating the interquartile range.
    • Finding quartiles in a data set → Measures of variability: range
      Reason: range"

Cycle 197 (Length 3): triangle defined by three non-collinear points → convex set → triangle defined by three non-collinear points
  Relationships in this cycle:
    • triangle defined by three non-collinear points → convex set
      Reason: The definition of a triangle as a shape formed by three non-collinear points inherently involves the concept of a convex set, as any triangle is a convex shape by nature.
    • convex set → triangle defined by three non-collinear points
      Reason: Understanding the concept of a convex set is essential for defining and working with triangles, as a triangle is a specific example of a convex set formed by three non-collinear points.
