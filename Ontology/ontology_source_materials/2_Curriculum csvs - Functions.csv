5.1 Functions,"– recognise that a function assigns a unique output to a given input 
 
  – form composite functions 
 
  – graph functions of the form 
   ax+b wherea,b∈Q,x∈R 
 
  ax2+bx + c 
 where a, b, c ∈ Z , x ∈ R 
 
  ax3+bx2 + cx+d 
 where a,b,c,d ∈ Z, x ∈ R 
 
  abx where a ∈ N, b, x ∈ R 
 
  
  – interpret equations of the form f(x) = g(x) as a comparison of the above functions 
 
  – use graphical methods to find approximate solutions to 
   f(x) = 0 
 
  f(x) = k 
 
  f(x) = g(x)
 where f(x) and g(x) are of the above form, or where graphs of f(x) and g(x) are provided 
 
  
  – investigate the concept of the limit of a function","– recognise surjective, injective and bijective functions 
 
  – find the inverse of a bijective function 
 
  – given a graph of a function sketch the graph 
 of its inverse 
 
  – express quadratic functions in complete 
 square form 
 
  – use the complete square form of a quadratic 
 function to
 • find the roots and turning points • sketch the function 
 
  – graph functions of the form 
   ax2+bx+cwherea,b,c∈Q,x∈R 
 
  abx where a, b ∈ R 
 
  logarithmic 
 
  exponential 
 
  trigonometric 
 
  
  – interpret equations of the form
 f(x) = g(x) as a comparison of the above functions 
 
  – informally explore limits and continuity of functions"
5.2 Calculus,"– find first and second derivatives of linear, quadratic and cubic functions by rule 
 
  – associate derivatives with slopes and tangent lines 
 
  – apply differentiation to • rates of change
 • maxima and minima • curve sketching","– differentiate linear and quadratic functions from first principles 
 
  – differentiate the following functions • polynomial 
 • exponential
 • trigonometric
 • rational powers
 • inverse functions • logarithms 
 
  – find the derivatives of sums, differences, products, quotients and compositions of functions of the above form 
 
  – apply the differentiation of above functions to solve problems 
 
  – use differentiation to find the slope of a tangent to a circle 
 
  – recognise integration as the reverse process of differentiation 
 
  – use integration to find the average value of a function over an interval
