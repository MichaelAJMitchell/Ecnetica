Topic,"Description of topic 
 Students learn about","Learning outcomes 
 Students should be able to"
4.1 (a) Generating arithmetic expressions from repeating patterns,"Patterns and the rules that govern them; students construct an understanding
 of a relationship as that which involves a set of inputs, a set of outputs and a correspondence from each input to each output.","– use tables to represent a repeating-pattern situation 
 
  – generalise and explain patterns and relationships in words and numbers 
 
  – write arithmetic expressions for particular terms in a sequence"
"4.1 (b) Representing situations with tables, diagrams and graphs","Relations derived from some kind of context – familiar, everyday situations, imaginary contexts or arrangements of tiles or blocks. Students look at various patterns and make predictions about what comes next.","– use tables, diagrams and graphs as tools for representing and analysing linear patterns and relationships 
 
  – develop and use their own generalising strategies and ideas and consider those of others 
 
  – present and interpret solutions, explaining and justifying methods, inferences and reasoning"
4.1 (c) Finding formulae,Ways to express a general relationship arising from a pattern or context.,– find the underlying formula written in words from which the data is derived (linear relationships)
4.1 (d) Examining algebraic relationships,"Features of a linear relationship and how these features appear in the different representations. Constant rate of change. 
 Proportional relationships.","– show that relations have features that can be represented in a variety of ways 
 
  – distinguish those features that are especially useful to identify and point out how those features appear in different representations: in tables, graphs, physical models, and formulae expressed in words 
 
  – use the representations to reason about the situation from which the relationship is derived and communicate their thinking to others 
 
  – discuss rate of change and the y-intercept; consider how these relate to the context from which the relationship is derived, and identify how they can appear in a table, in a graph and in a formula 
 
  – decide if two linear relationships have a common value 
 
  – recognise problems involving direct proportion and identify the necessary information to solve them"
