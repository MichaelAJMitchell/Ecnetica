 Students should be able to"
1.1 Counting,Listing outcomes of experiments in a systematic way.,"– list all possible outcomes of an experiment 
 
  – apply the fundamental principle of 
 counting"
1.2 Concepts of probability,"The probability of an event occurring: students progress from informal to formal descriptions of probability.
 Predicting and determining probabilities. Difference between experimental and theoretical probability.","– decide whether an everyday event is likely or unlikely to occur 
 
  – recognise that probability is a measure on a scale of 0-1 of how likely an event is to occur 
 
  – use the language of probability to discuss events, including those with equally likely outcomes 
 
  – estimate probabilities from experimental data 
 
  – recognise that, if an experiment is repeated, there will be different outcomes and that increasing the number of times an experiment is repeated generally leads to better estimates of probability 
 
  – associate the probability of an event with its long-run, relative frequency"
"1.3 Outcomes of simple random 
 processes",Finding the probability of equally likely outcomes.,"– construct sample spaces for two independent events 
 
  – apply the principle that, in the case of equally likely outcomes, the probability is given by the number of outcomes
 of interest divided by the total number of outcomes (examples using coins, dice, spinners, containers with different coloured objects, playing cards, sports results, etc.)"
"1.4 Statistical reasoning

 generalised

1.2 Concepts of probability,"– use set theory to discuss experiments, outcomes, sample spaces 
 
  – discuss basic rules of probability (AND/ OR, mutually exclusive) through the use of Venn diagrams

  – Addition Rule:
 P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B) 
 
  – Multiplication Rule (Independent Events): P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) 
 
  – Multiplication Rule (General Case): P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B | A) 
 
  – solve problems involving sampling, with or without replacement 
 
  – appreciate that in general P(A | B) ≠ P (B | A) 
 
  – examine the implications of P(A | B) ≠ P (B | A) in context"

  – apply an understanding of Bernoulli trials∗ 
 
  – solve problems involving up to 3 Bernoulli 
 trials

 success occurs on the nth Bernoulli trial where n is specified","– solve problems involving calculating the probability of k successes in n repeated Bernoulli trials (normal approximation not required) 
 
  – calculate the probability that the kth success occurs on the nth Bernoulli trial

 spreadsheets"
"1.6 Representing data graphically and 
 numerically","Methods of representing data.
 Students develop a sense that data can convey information and that organising data in different ways can help clarify what the data have to tell us. They see a data set as a whole and so are able to use proportions and measures of centre to describe the data.","Graphical 
   – select appropriate methods to represent and describe the sample (univariate data only) 
 
  – evaluate the effectiveness of different displays in representing the findings of a statistical investigation conducted by others 
 
  – use pie charts, bar charts, line plots, histograms (equal intervals), stem and leaf plots to display data

 • central tendency 
 mean, median, mode • variability – range"
