# Irrational Numbers

## Rational Numbers Revision

### Theory

Before we dive into the fascinating world of irrational numbers, let's take a moment to review what we know about rational numbers and discover the patterns that will help us recognize when we've stepped beyond them.

Notice how rational numbers always produce predictable decimal patterns. This is important because it's exactly what irrational numbers don't do! When we convert rational numbers to decimals, we see two distinct types:

**Terminating Decimals:** These occur when the denominator (in lowest terms) contains only factors of 2 and 5

$$\frac{3}{8} = \frac{3}{2^3} = 0.375 \quad \text{(Stops after 3 decimal places)}$$

$$\frac{7}{25} = \frac{7}{5^2} = 0.28 \quad \text{(Terminates exactly)}$$

**Repeating Decimals:** These happen when the denominator has prime factors other than 2 and 5

$$\frac{1}{3} = 0.\overline{3} = 0.333... \quad \text{(Single digit repeats)}$$

$$\frac{5}{11} = 0.\overline{45} = 0.454545... \quad \text{(Two-digit pattern repeats)}$$

Here's why this matters: every rational number fits into one of these two categories. There are no exceptions! This predictable behavior is what makes rational numbers so... well, rational.

### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Predicting Decimal Behavior

Let's determine whether $\frac{7}{12}$ will terminate or repeat before we even do the division.

**Method: Prime Factorization Analysis**

$$\frac{7}{12} = \frac{7}{2^2 \times 3} \quad \text{(Factor the denominator)}$$

Since the denominator contains the prime factor 3 (which is neither 2 nor 5), this fraction will produce a repeating decimal.

**Verification by Division:**

$$\frac{7}{12} = 0.58\overline{3} = 0.58333... \quad \text{(The 3 repeats infinitely!)}$$

##### Example 2: Understanding Why Termination Occurs

Let's see why $\frac{9}{40}$ terminates:

$$\frac{9}{40} = \frac{9}{2^3 \times 5} \quad \text{(Only factors of 2 and 5)}$$

Here's the key insight: we can always convert this to a denominator that's a power of 10:

$$\frac{9}{40} = \frac{9}{2^3 \times 5} = \frac{9 \times 5^2}{2^3 \times 5 \times 5^2} = \frac{225}{1000} = 0.225$$

## Irrational Numbers

### Theory

Now let's explore one of the most beautiful discoveries in mathematics: numbers that break the predictable patterns we've just studied! **Irrational numbers** are real numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, no matter how hard we try.

**The Set of Irrational Numbers:**

$$\mathbb{I} = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \text{ cannot be written as } \frac{a}{b} \text{ where } a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0\}$$

Here's what makes irrational numbers so fascinating: their decimal representations never terminate and never repeat. Ever! No matter how many decimal places you calculate, you'll never find a pattern that repeats forever.

**Key Characteristics of Irrational Numbers:**

**Non-Terminating:** The decimal expansion goes on forever
**Non-Repeating:** No block of digits ever repeats in a predictable cycle
**Infinite Precision:** Cannot be expressed exactly as any fraction

**Common Sources of Irrational Numbers:**

**Square Roots of Non-Perfect Squares:**

When we try to find the exact value of square roots like $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{3}$, $\sqrt{5}$, we discover they can't be expressed as fractions.

$$\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356... \quad \text{(Goes on forever without repeating)}$$

**Mathematical Constants:**

Some of the most important numbers in mathematics are irrational:

• **Pi:** $\pi = 3.14159265358979... \quad \text{(Ratio of circumference to diameter)}$
• **Euler's number:** $e = 2.71828182845904... \quad \text{(Base of natural logarithms)}$
• **Golden ratio:** $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.61803398... \quad \text{(Found throughout nature)}$

**The Relationship Between Number Sets:**

It's worth taking a moment to appreciate how irrational numbers complete our understanding of real numbers:

$$\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q} \cup \mathbb{I} \quad \text{(Real numbers = Rationals ∪ Irrationals)}$$

$$\mathbb{Q} \cap \mathbb{I} = \emptyset \quad \text{(No number can be both rational and irrational)}$$

This means every real number is either rational or irrational - there's no middle ground!

**Understanding Irrationality Through Contradiction:**

Let's explore why $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational using a beautiful proof by contradiction:

Suppose $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$ where $a, b$ are integers with no common factors.

Then: $2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}$, so $2b^2 = a^2$

This means $a^2$ is even, which requires $a$ to be even. Let $a = 2k$.

Substituting: $2b^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$, so $b^2 = 2k^2$

This means $b^2$ is even, so $b$ is even too.

But if both $a$ and $b$ are even, they have a common factor of 2, contradicting our assumption!

Therefore, $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be rational - it must be irrational.

**Density of Irrational Numbers:**

Here's a surprising fact: between any two rational numbers, there are infinitely many irrational numbers! In fact, there are "more" irrational numbers than rational numbers in a very precise mathematical sense.

### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Approximating Square Roots

Let's work through approximating $\sqrt{7}$ using the squeeze method. This might seem challenging at first, but we'll build our answer systematically.

**Method 1: Perfect Square Bounds**

Here's how we start by finding the perfect squares that bracket 7:

$$2^2 = 4 < 7 < 9 = 3^2 \quad \text{(Initial bounds)}$$

Taking square roots preserves the inequality:

$$2 < \sqrt{7} < 3 \quad \text{(First approximation)}$$

**Method 2: Refining the Bounds**

Let's try values between 2 and 3:

$$2.6^2 = 6.76 < 7 < 7.29 = 2.7^2 \quad \text{(Getting closer)}$$

$$2.6 < \sqrt{7} < 2.7 \quad \text{(Better bounds)}$$

We can continue: $2.64^2 = 6.9696 < 7 < 7.0225 = 2.65^2$

$$2.64 < \sqrt{7} < 2.65 \quad \text{(Even more precise)}$$

The key insight here is that $\sqrt{7} = 2.6457513...$ goes on forever without repeating!

##### Example 2: Identifying Rational vs. Irrational

Let's determine whether $\sqrt{36}$ is rational or irrational:

$$\sqrt{36} = 6 \quad \text{(Perfect square)}$$

$$6 = \frac{6}{1} \quad \text{(Can be expressed as a fraction)}$$

Therefore, $\sqrt{36}$ is rational, not irrational. This shows us that not all square roots are irrational - only square roots of non-perfect squares are irrational.

##### Example 3: Working with Pi

Here's a practical example: The circumference of a circle with radius 5 cm involves $\pi$:

$$C = 2\pi r = 2\pi(5) = 10\pi \text{ cm} \quad \text{(Exact answer)}$$

$$C \approx 10 \times 3.14159 = 31.4159 \text{ cm} \quad \text{(Approximation)}$$

Notice how we can work with irrational numbers exactly (using the symbol $\pi$) or approximately (using decimal approximations). The exact form is often more useful in mathematics!

### Key Takeaways

```{important}
1. **Irrational numbers** cannot be expressed as fractions of integers: $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, $b \neq 0$
2. **Decimal representations** are non-terminating and non-repeating (no predictable pattern)
3. **Square roots** of non-perfect squares are always irrational: $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{3}$, $\sqrt{5}$, etc.
4. **Famous irrational constants**: $\pi$ (3.14159...), $e$ (2.71828...), $\phi$ (1.61803...)
5. **Real number completeness**: $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q} \cup \mathbb{I}$ and $\mathbb{Q} \cap \mathbb{I} = \emptyset$
6. **Approximation necessity**: Practical calculations require decimal approximations
7. **Density property**: Between any two rationals, there are infinitely many irrationals
8. **Applications everywhere**: From architecture to physics, irrational numbers describe natural phenomena accurately
