## Linear Equations Revision

### Theory

Before we dive into the fascinating world of quadratic functions, let's take a moment to revisit our foundation - linear equations. This revision is crucial because every skill you've mastered with linear equations becomes a stepping stone for understanding quadratics!

A linear equation in **standard form** is:

$$ax + b = 0$$

where $a \neq 0$. Here's why this matters: the systematic approach we use to solve linear equations - isolating the variable, maintaining balance, and step-by-step manipulation - forms the foundation for all algebraic problem-solving.

**The Solution Process**:

$$ax + b = 0$$
$$ax = -b \quad \text{(subtracting b from both sides)}$$
$$x = -\frac{b}{a} \quad \text{(dividing both sides by a)}$$

This gives us the solution $x = -\frac{b}{a}$, which represents where the line $y = ax + b$ crosses the x-axis.

```{tip}
When solving linear equations, always perform the same operation to both sides of the equation. This fundamental principle of maintaining equality will be essential when we tackle quadratic equations!

### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Building Confidence with Linear Equations
Let's solve: $3x - 12 = 0$

**Method 1: Direct Manipulation**

$3x - 12 = 0 \quad \text{(starting equation)}$

$3x = 12 \quad \text{(adding 12 to both sides)}$

$x = 4 \quad \text{(dividing both sides by 3)}$

**Method 2: Formula Application**

With $a = 3$ and $b = -12$:

$x = -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{(-12)}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \quad \text{(same answer!)}$

##### Example 2: Fractional Coefficients
Let's work through: $\frac{2}{3}x + 4 = 0$

**Method 1: Clear Fractions First**

$\frac{2}{3}x + 4 = 0 \quad \text{(multiply everything by 3)}$

$2x + 12 = 0 \quad \text{(now we have integers!)}$

$2x = -12 \quad \text{(subtract 12 from both sides)}$

$x = -6 \quad \text{(divide by 2)}$

```{warning}
Don't rush through linear equation review! The systematic thinking you develop here - isolating variables, maintaining equation balance, checking solutions - is exactly what you'll need for quadratic equations.
```

### Key Takeaways

```{important}
1. **Linear equations** have the form $ax + b = 0$ and represent straight lines when graphed
2. **Systematic solution process**: Isolate the variable by performing inverse operations in the correct order
3. **Balance principle**: Whatever operation you do to one side, you must do to the other side
4. **Solution verification**: Always substitute your answer back into the original equation to check
5. **Foundation skills**: These algebraic manipulation techniques are essential for solving quadratic equations
```

## Quadratic Equations and their Form

### Theory

Now here's where mathematics becomes truly exciting! A quadratic equation is our gateway from the straight-line world of linear equations into the curved, elegant world of parabolas. Let's explore what makes these equations so special and powerful.

**The Standard Form of a Quadratic Equation**

A quadratic equation in standard form is:

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, and crucially, $a \neq 0$. Notice what happens if $a = 0$ - we'd just have $bx + c = 0$, which is a linear equation!

**Understanding the Components**

- **The $ax^2$ term**: This is what makes it quadratic! The presence of $x^2$ creates the characteristic curved shape when graphed.
- **The $bx$ term**: This linear component influences the position and orientation of the parabola.
- **The $c$ term**: This constant determines where the parabola crosses the y-axis.

```{important}
The coefficient $a$ determines the direction of the parabola: if $a > 0$, it opens upward (like a smile); if $a < 0$, it opens downward (like a frown).
```

**From Quadratic Functions to Quadratic Equations**

When we have a quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ and we want to find where it crosses the x-axis, we set $f(x) = 0$, giving us the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

**Recognizing Quadratic Equations**

Not all equations with $x^2$ terms are quadratic equations! Here's how to identify them:

✓ **True quadratic equations**:
- $x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0$ (standard form)
- $2x^2 = 8$ (missing linear term, but still quadratic)
- $(x-1)(x+3) = 0$ (factored form)

✗ **Not quadratic equations**:
- $x^3 + x^2 - 2 = 0$ (highest power is 3, so it's cubic)
- $\frac{1}{x^2} + x = 0$ (negative power of x)

```{tip}
To identify a quadratic equation, first expand and simplify it completely. If the highest power of $x$ is 2, and the coefficient of $x^2$ is not zero, then it's quadratic!
```

                    b: { min: -5, max: 5, value: 0, step: 0.1 },
                    c: { min: -5, max: 5, value: 0, step: 0.1 }
                },

            }
        ]
    });
});
</script>


### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Converting to Standard Form
Let's work through: $(2x - 1)(x + 3) = 5$

**Method 1: Expand then Rearrange**

$(2x - 1)(x + 3) = 5 \quad \text{(expand the left side)}$

$2x^2 + 6x - x - 3 = 5 \quad \text{(using FOIL method)}$

$2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 5 \quad \text{(combining like terms)}$

$2x^2 + 5x - 8 = 0 \quad \text{(subtracting 5 from both sides)}$

Now we have it in standard form with $a = 2$, $b = 5$, $c = -8$.

##### Example 2: Identifying Quadratic Equations  
Let's solve: Is $3x^2 + \frac{2}{x} - 1 = 0$ a quadratic equation?

**Method 1: Analyze the Terms**

$3x^2 + \frac{2}{x} - 1 = 0 \quad \text{(rewrite the fraction)}$

$3x^2 + 2x^{-1} - 1 = 0 \quad \text{(now we can see the powers clearly)}$

This equation contains $x^{-1}$ (a negative power), so it's not a quadratic equation. A true quadratic can only have non-negative integer powers of $x$, with the highest power being 2.

##### Example 3: Hidden Quadratic
Let's work through: $t^4 - 5t^2 + 6 = 0$

**Method 1: Substitution Technique**

$t^4 - 5t^2 + 6 = 0 \quad \text{(let } u = t^2 \text{)}$

$u^2 - 5u + 6 = 0 \quad \text{(now this is quadratic in } u \text{!)}$

This is a clever technique - by substituting $u = t^2$, we transform a quartic (4th degree) equation into a quadratic equation in terms of $u$.

```{note}
The standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is more than just a format - it's the launching pad for all quadratic solution methods. Getting comfortable with converting equations to this form will save you time and reduce errors throughout this topic.
```

### Key Takeaways

```{important}
1. **Standard form** is $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $a ≠ 0$ is the essential requirement
2. **Coefficient significance**: $a$ determines parabola direction, $b$ affects position, $c$ is the y-intercept
3. **Conversion skills**: Always expand, simplify, and rearrange to get equations in standard form
4. **Recognition patterns**: Look for $x^2$ as the highest power with integer exponents only
5. **Foundation for solutions**: Standard form enables all quadratic solving methods
6. **Real-world appearance**: Quadratic equations naturally model projectile motion, optimization, and curved relationships
```

## Factorizing Quadratic Equations by Inspection

### Theory

Now let's explore one of the most elegant methods for solving quadratic equations - factorization by inspection! This method is like finding the perfect key for a lock - when it works, it's incredibly satisfying and efficient.

**The Foundation: Zero Product Property**

The power of factorization lies in a fundamental property: if $A \times B = 0$, then either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$ (or both). This means if we can write our quadratic as a product of two factors equal to zero, we can solve it immediately!

**When $a = 1$: The Simpler Case**

For equations like $x^2 + bx + c = 0$, we look for two numbers that:
- **Multiply** to give $c$ (the constant term)
- **Add** to give $b$ (the coefficient of $x$)

If we find such numbers $p$ and $q$, then:
$$x^2 + bx + c = (x + p)(x + q)$$

**When $a ≠ 1$: The Challenging Case** 

For equations like $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $a ≠ 1$, we look for two numbers that:
- **Multiply** to give $ac$ (product of first and last coefficients)
- **Add** to give $b$ (the middle coefficient)

```{tip}
Start with factorization when you see "nice" integer coefficients, especially when $a = 1$. This method is often the fastest when it works!
```

**Strategic Approach**

1. **Check for common factors first** - factor out any common terms
2. **Identify the type** - is $a = 1$ or $a ≠ 1$?
3. **Find the number pair** using the appropriate rule
4. **Write the factors** and solve using the zero product property
5. **Always verify** your solutions in the original equation

```{warning}
Factorization doesn't always work with integer factors! If you can't find suitable integers quickly, move to completing the square or the quadratic formula.
```


### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Factorization when $a = 1$
Let's solve: $x^2 + 7x + 12 = 0$

**Method 1: Find the Number Pair**

We need two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7.

$x^2 + 7x + 12 = 0 \quad \text{(factors of 12: 1×12, 2×6, 3×4)}$

$x^2 + 7x + 12 = 0 \quad \text{(which pair adds to 7? That's 3 and 4!)}$

$(x + 3)(x + 4) = 0 \quad \text{(factored form)}$

$x + 3 = 0 \text{ or } x + 4 = 0 \quad \text{(zero product property)}$

$x = -3 \text{ or } x = -4 \quad \text{(our solutions)}$

##### Example 2: Factorization when $a ≠ 1$
Let's work through: $6x^2 + 7x + 2 = 0$

**Method 1: Find Factors of $ac$**

We need two numbers that multiply to $ac = 6 × 2 = 12$ and add to $b = 7$.

$6x^2 + 7x + 2 = 0 \quad \text{(factors of 12: 1×12, 2×6, 3×4)}$

$6x^2 + 7x + 2 = 0 \quad \text{(which pair adds to 7? That's 3 and 4!)}$

$6x^2 + 3x + 4x + 2 = 0 \quad \text{(split the middle term)}$

$3x(2x + 1) + 2(2x + 1) = 0 \quad \text{(factor by grouping)}$

$(3x + 2)(2x + 1) = 0 \quad \text{(factored form)}$

$3x + 2 = 0 \text{ or } 2x + 1 = 0 \quad \text{(zero product property)}$

$x = -\frac{2}{3} \text{ or } x = -\frac{1}{2} \quad \text{(our solutions)}$

##### Example 3: When Factorization Doesn't Work Nicely
Let's solve: $x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0$

**Method 1: Attempt Factorization**

We need two numbers that multiply to 1 and add to 3.

$x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \quad \text{(factors of 1: only 1×1)}$

$x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \quad \text{(but 1 + 1 = 2, not 3!)}$

Since we can't find integer factors, this equation requires the quadratic formula or completing the square. This shows that factorization has limitations!

```{seealso}
Factorization connects beautifully to polynomial theory and will reappear when you study cubic equations, rational functions, and even complex numbers. The zero product property is fundamental across all of algebra!
```

### Key Takeaways

```{important}
1. **Zero product property** is the foundation: if $A × B = 0$, then $A = 0$ or $B = 0$
2. **When $a = 1$**: Find two numbers that multiply to $c$ and add to $b$
3. **When $a ≠ 1$**: Find two numbers that multiply to $ac$ and add to $b$, then use grouping
4. **Efficiency advantage**: Factorization is the fastest method when it works with integer factors
5. **Limitation awareness**: Not all quadratics factor nicely - be ready to switch methods
6. **Always verify**: Check your solutions by substituting back into the original equation
```

## Deriving and Using the Quadratic Formula

### Theory

Welcome to one of mathematics' most powerful and reliable tools - the quadratic formula! This beautiful equation can solve ANY quadratic equation, making it the "universal key" for quadratic problems. Let's explore how this formula is born from completing the square and why it's so incredibly useful.

**The Journey to the Formula**

The quadratic formula doesn't just appear from nowhere - it's derived by completing the square on the general form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. Let's see this elegant derivation:

Starting with: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$

$ax^2 + bx = -c \quad \text{(moving the constant)}$

$x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a} \quad \text{(dividing by a)}$

Now we complete the square by adding $\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2$ to both sides:

$x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2$

$\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2} \quad \text{(perfect square on left)}$

$\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{-4ac + b^2}{4a^2} = \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}$

Taking square roots of both sides:

$x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

$x = -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

**The Quadratic Formula**:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

```{important}
The quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ works for ANY quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $a ≠ 0$.
```

**Understanding the Components**

- **$-b$**: This centers the formula around the axis of symmetry
- **$\pm$**: This gives us both roots (the parabola typically crosses the x-axis at two points)
- **$b^2 - 4ac$**: This is the discriminant - it determines the nature of the roots
- **$2a$**: This accounts for the parabola's width and orientation

**When to Use the Quadratic Formula**

✓ **Always works** - unlike factorization, which only works for some equations
✓ **Decimal coefficients** - handles non-integer coefficients perfectly  
✓ **Irrational solutions** - gives exact answers using radicals
✓ **Complex solutions** - works even when solutions aren't real numbers

```{tip}
Memorize the quadratic formula! It's worth investing time to know it by heart: "x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over two a."

### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Standard Application
Let's solve: $2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0$

**Method 1: Apply the Quadratic Formula**

We identify: $a = 2$, $b = 5$, $c = -3$

$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \quad \text{(substitute our values)}$

$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(2)(-3)}}{2(2)} \quad \text{(calculate discriminant)}$

$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 24}}{4} \quad \text{(simplify under radical)}$

$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{49}}{4} = \frac{-5 \pm 7}{4} \quad \text{(perfect square!)}$

$x = \frac{-5 + 7}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ or } x = \frac{-5 - 7}{4} = \frac{-12}{4} = -3$

##### Example 2: Irrational Solutions
Let's work through: $x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0$

**Method 1: Quadratic Formula with Irrational Result**

We identify: $a = 1$, $b = 4$, $c = 1$

$x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} \quad \text{(substitute values)}$

$x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} \quad \text{(calculate discriminant)}$

$x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{12}}{2} \quad \text{(simplify radical)}$

$x = \frac{-4 \pm 2\sqrt{3}}{2} = -2 \pm \sqrt{3} \quad \text{(exact solutions)}$

So $x = -2 + \sqrt{3} \approx -0.27$ or $x = -2 - \sqrt{3} \approx -3.73$

##### Example 3: No Real Solutions  
Let's solve: $x^2 + 2x + 5 = 0$

**Method 1: Recognizing Complex Solutions**

We identify: $a = 1$, $b = 2$, $c = 5$

$x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(5)}}{2(1)} \quad \text{(substitute values)}$

$x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 20}}{2} \quad \text{(calculate discriminant)}$

$x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{-16}}{2} \quad \text{(negative under radical!)}$

Since we have $\sqrt{-16}$, this equation has no real solutions. The graph of $y = x^2 + 2x + 5$ never crosses the x-axis.

```{note}
The quadratic formula connects beautifully to many advanced topics: it leads naturally to complex numbers, connects to the discriminant (our next topic), and forms the foundation for understanding polynomial equations in general.
```

### Key Takeaways

```{important}
1. **Universal solver**: The quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ works for ANY quadratic equation
2. **Derived from completing the square**: Understanding the derivation helps you remember and trust the formula
3. **Handles all cases**: Works when factorization fails, especially with decimal coefficients or irrational solutions
4. **Exact answers**: Gives precise results using radicals rather than decimal approximations
5. **Memorization essential**: This formula is worth committing to memory for lifelong use
6. **Real-world power**: Indispensable for engineering, science, and complex problem-solving where "nice" integer solutions are rare
```

## The Discriminant and Nature of Roots

### Theory

Now let's explore the discriminant - a powerful mathematical detective that can tell us everything about a quadratic equation's solutions before we even solve it! The discriminant is the expression under the square root in the quadratic formula, and it holds the key to understanding the nature of solutions.

**The Discriminant Formula**

For any quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the discriminant is:

$$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$$

(The symbol $\Delta$ is the Greek letter "delta," commonly used for the discriminant.)

**The Three Cases: A Complete Classification**

The discriminant completely determines what kinds of solutions we'll get:

**Case 1: $\Delta > 0$ (Positive Discriminant)**
- **Two distinct real roots**
- The parabola crosses the x-axis at two different points
- We get two different rational or irrational solutions
- Example: $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$ has $\Delta = 25 - 24 = 1 > 0$

**Case 2: $\Delta = 0$ (Zero Discriminant)**  
- **One repeated real root** (also called a "double root")
- The parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point (the vertex)
- We get one solution that appears twice
- Example: $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0$ has $\Delta = 16 - 16 = 0$

**Case 3: $\Delta < 0$ (Negative Discriminant)**
- **No real roots** (two complex conjugate roots)
- The parabola doesn't touch the x-axis at all
- We get complex solutions involving $i = \sqrt{-1}$
- Example: $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ has $\Delta = 1 - 4 = -3 < 0$

```{important}
The discriminant $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ is like a mathematical crystal ball - it predicts the nature of solutions before you solve the equation!
```

**Special Case: Perfect Square Discriminants**

When $\Delta$ is a perfect square (like 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...), the quadratic equation has rational solutions. This often means the equation can be factored with integer coefficients!

**Geometric Interpretation**

The discriminant directly relates to the graph of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$:
- $\Delta > 0$: Graph crosses x-axis twice
- $\Delta = 0$: Graph touches x-axis once (vertex on x-axis)  
- $\Delta < 0$: Graph doesn't touch x-axis

```{tip}
Calculate the discriminant first when analyzing quadratic equations! It immediately tells you what type of solutions to expect and which solution method might be most efficient.
```

**Connection to Other Concepts**

The discriminant connects to several important ideas:
- **Factorization**: If $\Delta$ is a perfect square, factorization often works
- **Vertex**: When $\Delta = 0$, the vertex lies on the x-axis
- **Optimization**: In real-world problems, $\Delta = 0$ often represents optimal conditions
- **Complex numbers**: Negative discriminants introduce complex solutions

```{warning}
Be careful with signs when calculating $b^2 - 4ac$! The most common error is incorrectly handling negative values of $b$ or $c$.
```


### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Analyzing Without Solving
Let's analyze: $2x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0$

**Method 1: Discriminant Analysis**

We identify: $a = 2$, $b = -7$, $c = 3$

$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \quad \text{(apply discriminant formula)}$

$\Delta = (-7)^2 - 4(2)(3) \quad \text{(substitute values carefully)}$

$\Delta = 49 - 24 = 25 \quad \text{(calculate)}$

Since $\Delta = 25 > 0$ and $25 = 5^2$ (perfect square), this equation has two distinct rational roots. We know without solving that factorization will work nicely!

##### Example 2: Vertex on x-axis
Let's work through: $x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0$

**Method 1: Recognizing Special Cases**

We identify: $a = 1$, $b = 6$, $c = 9$

$\Delta = 6^2 - 4(1)(9) \quad \text{(calculate discriminant)}$

$\Delta = 36 - 36 = 0 \quad \text{(zero discriminant!)}$

Since $\Delta = 0$, this equation has one repeated real root. The parabola $y = x^2 + 6x + 9$ touches the x-axis at exactly one point. Notice that this factors as $(x + 3)^2 = 0$, giving $x = -3$ twice.

##### Example 3: No Real Solutions
Let's solve: $3x^2 + 2x + 5 = 0$

**Method 1: Discriminant First**

We identify: $a = 3$, $b = 2$, $c = 5$

$\Delta = 2^2 - 4(3)(5) \quad \text{(calculate discriminant)}$

$\Delta = 4 - 60 = -56 \quad \text{(negative discriminant)}$

Since $\Delta = -56 < 0$, this equation has no real solutions. The parabola $y = 3x^2 + 2x + 5$ never crosses the x-axis. In the complex number system, the solutions would involve $\sqrt{-56} = 2i\sqrt{14}$.

The discriminant appears throughout advanced mathematics: in conic sections (distinguishing parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas), in the study of polynomial equations of higher degree, and in numerical analysis for understanding solution sensitivity.

### Key Takeaways

```{important}
1. **Discriminant formula**: $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ predicts solution types before solving
2. **Three cases**: $\Delta > 0$ (two real roots), $\Delta = 0$ (one repeated root), $\Delta < 0$ (no real roots)
3. **Perfect squares**: When $\Delta$ is a perfect square, solutions are rational and factorization often works
4. **Geometric meaning**: Discriminant determines how many times the parabola crosses the x-axis
5. **Problem-solving efficiency**: Calculate discriminant first to choose the best solution method
6. **Real-world analysis**: Use discriminant to analyze system behavior, stability, and feasibility before detailed calculations
