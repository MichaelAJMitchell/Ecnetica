Algebra 1
Section 1.1  Polynomial expressions   
Polynomial expressions are formed from the addition  
of  many  algebraic terms with  positive integer powers.
5 x 3   !  3 x 2   "  4 x   !  6 is a polynomial expression.
This expression consists of four  terms ;  
5 x 3 ,  ! 3 x 2 , 4 x  and  ! 6.
The  degree  of a polynomial is given by the highest  
power of  x.
(a) 4 x   !  6 is a  linear  polynomial since the highest power (degree) of  x  is 1.
(b)  ! 3 x 2   "  4 x   !  6 is a  quadratic  polynomial of degree 2.
(c) 5 x 3   !  3 x 2   "  4 x   !  6 is a  cubic  polynomial of degree 3.
Each polynomial is written in order  of   (i) decreasing powers of  x , e.g. 5 x 3   !  3 x 2   "  4 x   !  6,  
or (ii) increasing powers of  x , e.g. 9  "  3 x   !  4 x 2 .
The  coefﬁcient  of  x 3  is the number before  x 3  in the expression. 
In 4 x 3   !  2 x 2   "  5 x   !  6, the coefﬁcient of  x 3  is 4, the coefﬁcient of  x 2  is  ! 2, the coefﬁcient of  x  
is 5, and  ! 6 is the  constant term .
1. Addition and subtraction of polynomial expressions
Each term in a polynomial represents a different quantity, e.g. 8, 6 x , 4 x 2 .
When simplifying an expression, all like terms should be combined into a single term. 
A  binomial  expression 
contains two terms.
A  trinomial  expression 
contains three terms.

2. Multiplying polynomial expressions
To multiply algebraic expressions, we use the distributive law, i.e.  a ( b  "  c )   #  ab  "  ac .
Note:  Multiplying polynomial expressions is often called  expanding .
3. Perfect squares
Any polynomial of the form ( x   "   a ) 2   is called a  perfect square.
( x   "   a ) 2    #  ( x   "   a )( x   "   a )  
#  ( x )( x   "   a )  "  ( a )( x   "   a )  
#   x 2   "   ax   "   ax   "   a 2   
#   x 2   "  2 ax   "   a 2
Similarly, ( x   !   a ) 2    #   x 2   !  2 ax   "   a 2 .
For example, (2 x   !  3) 2   #  (2 x ) 2   !  2(2 x )(3)   "  (3) 2   #  4 x 2   !  12 x   "  9
( x   "   a ) 2   #   x 2   "  2 ax   "   a 2
( x   !   a ) 2   #   x 2   !  2 ax   "   a 2

4. Expanding ( x   !   a )( x   "   a )
The expansion of ( x   !   a )( x   "   a )   #   x 2   "   ax   !   ax   !   a 2   
#   x 2   !   a 2
Similarly, ( a   !  5 b )( a  "  5 b )  #   a 2   !  5 ab   "  5 ab   !  (5 b ) 2   #   a 2   !   (5 b ) 2  
#   a 2   !  25 b 2
This expansion results in a binomial expression called the  difference of two squares. 
This result is important when we need to factorise an expression of the form  a 2   !   b 2  as we 
will see later on in the chapter.
5. Dividing algebraic expressions
Algebraic quotients take many different forms. Some may be simpliﬁed as in the  
following cases.
Case 1.  The denominator is a factor of each term of the numerator.
 (i)   6 x 3   !  8 x 2 y   "  4 xy 2   "  2 x 2  
 
_____________________

2 x     "   2 x 2  
___  
2 x     #  3 x 2   !  4 xy   "  2 y 2  "   x
Case 2.  The denominator is one of the factors of the numerator.
 (ii)   6 x 2   "  5 xy   "   y 2  
 
_____________  
(2 x   "   y )

_______________  
 
(2 x   "   y )  
  #  3 x   "   y
Case 3.  The denominator divides into the numerator using long division.
 (iii)   2 x 3   !  9 x 2   "  10 x   !  3

--- Page 4 ---

Note also that when we divide 2 x 3   !  11 x   "  6 by  x   !  2 we get 2 x 2   "  4 x   !  3. 
The factors of the polynomial 2 x 3   !  11 x   "  6  
are ( x   !  2) and (2 x 2   "  4 x   !  3), 
i.e. 2 x 3   !  11 x   "  6  #  ( x   !  2)(2 x 2   "  4 x   !  3). 
We will use this property more fully in the chapter on  
factorisation.

Section 1.2  Polynomial functions, an introduction   
Polynomial functions arise as we try to solve day-to-day  
problems.
Let  x  cm be the length of a rectangle. 
If the width of the rectangle is 5 cm shorter than the length,  
then ( x   !  5) cm is the width.
The area,  A , of the rectangle depends on the length and width and  
by extension depends on  x .
The symbol for the area depending on  x  is written as  A ( x ) . 
Therefore,  A ( x )  #   x ( x   !  5)  #   x 2   !  5 x.  As  x  varies, the area  A  varies.
x  is called the  independent variable  and  A ( x ) the  dependent variable . 
A ( x ) is the quadratic polynomial  x 2   !  5 x  of   degree 2.
We note that if  x   #  10 cm, then  A (10)  #  (10) 2   !  5(10)  #  50 cm 2 .
We also note that the width is ( x  !  5)   ⇒   x  !   5  $  0  
⇒   x  $   5 cm

--- Page 7 ---

Note 1:    A ( x ) must be understood as a single concept and does not imply that  A  is  
multiplied by  x .  
It simply tells us that the quantity  A  depends on a variable  x.
Note 2:   Polynomial functions can be added and subtracted as before by collecting like terms 
and simplifying.
Evaluating polynomial functions  
The value of a polynomial function is obtained by substituting a given value for the 
independent variable and simplifying. 
If  p ( x )  #  2 x 2   !  5 x   "  6, then  p (1)  #  2(1) 2   !  5(1)  "  6  #  3
and  p ( ! 3)  #  2( ! 3) 2   !  5( ! 3)  "  6  #  39.

--- Page 8 ---

A new variable can also be introduced in a similar way. 
Given that  p ( x )  #  2 x 2   !  5 x   "  6,
 
p ( t )  #  2 t  2   !  5 t   "  6.
Also 
p ( t  2 )  #  2( t  2 ) 2   !  5( t  2 )   "  6  #  2 t  4   !  5 t  2   "  6

--- Page 9 ---

Note:  
Polynomial functions with more than one independent variable occur regularly.
The volume of a cylinder  V   #   % . r 2 .h , where  r  is the radius of the base and  h  the 
height of the cylinder. 
In function terms:  V ( r ,  h )  #   % . r 2 .h , 
that is, the volume of the cylinder depends on both the radius,  r , and the height,  h . 
The volume  V  depends on two independent variables,  r ,  h .
The degree of this polynomial is 2, the highest power (index) of either variable.

Section 1.3  Factorising algebraic expressions   
An algebraic  factor  divides evenly into a polynomial leaving no remainder. 
( x   !  3) is a factor of 2 x 3   !  9 x 2   "  10 x   !  3 
because (2 x 3   !  9 x 2   "  10 x   !  3)  &  ( x   !  3)  #  (2 x 2   !  3 x   "  1).
( x   !  4) and ( x   "  3) are both factors of  x 2   !   x   !  12 because 
(i) ( x 2   !   x   !  12)  &  ( x   !  4)  #  ( x   "  3) and also (ii) ( x 2   !   x   !  12)  &  ( x   "  3)  #  ( x   !  4).
To solve algebraic equations, we ﬁrst need to be able to factorise different  
algebraic expressions. 
Several different techniques can be used for factorising expressions and these  
are shown below.
1. Finding the highest common factor by inspection
 (i) 3 x 2   !  9 xy   #  3 x ( x   !  3 y )  ⇒  the factors are 3 x  and ( x   !  3 y )
 (ii) 2 a 2 b   !  4 ab 2   "  12  abc   #  2 ab ( a   !  2 b  "  6 c )  ⇒  the factors are 2 ab  and ( a   !  2 ab   "  6 c ).
2. Grouping terms
6 x 2 y   "  3 xy 2   !  12 x   !  6 y   #  3 xy (2 x  "   y )   !  6(2 x   "   y ) 
 
#  (2 x   "   y )(3 xy   !  6) 
 
⇒  the factors are (2 x   "   y ) and (3 xy   !  6)
3. Diﬀerence of two squares
Since ( x   "   y )( x   !   y )  #   x 2   !   y 2 , the factors of  x 2   !   y 2  are ( x  "   y ) and ( x   !   y ).
Note:  
 When simplifying quotients, it is important to be able to factorise fully 
expressions containing the difference of two squares.
 (i)  c 2   !   d  2  
#  ( c   !   d  )( c   "   d  ) 
 (ii)  x 2   !  9 y 2   #   x 2   !  (3 y ) 2   #  ( x   !  3 y )( x   "  3 y )
 (iii)  x 2   !  8 y 2   #   x 2   !  (  √

4. Factorising quadratic expressions
We can factorise quadratic expressions of the form  ax 2   "  bx   "   c  using either
 
(i) trial and error  or
 
(ii) when the coefﬁcients are large or irrational, the quadratic formula.
 (i)  x 2  "  3 x   !  18  #  ( x   '  ?)( x   '  ?)  … checking all the factor pairs of  ! 18
#  ( x   "  6)( x   !  3)  …  ( ' 1,  ' 18), ( ' 2,  ' 9), ( ' 3,  ' 6) … ( " 6,  ! 3) is the factor pair 
which, when added, produces  " 3 for the middle term.
 (ii) 3 x 2   !  17 x   "  20  #   ax 2   "   bx  "   c  →   a   #  3,  b   #   ! 17,  c   #  20.

5. Factorising expressions of the form  x 3   !   y 3  and  x 3   "   y 3
We can show by long division that ( x   !   y ) is a  
factor of  x 3   !   y 3 , creating a second factor  
x 2   "   xy   "   y 2 .
Therefore, we can write 
x 3   !   y  3   #   ( x   !   y )( x 2   "   xy   "   y 2 ). 
Similarly, we have that 
x 3  "   y 3   #  ( x   "   y )( x 2   !   xy   "   y 2 ). 
If we can write a polynomial in one of these  
forms, we can use these factor pairs as templates  
to ﬁnd its factors.
For example, we can write
 
(i) 27 x 3  "   y 3   #  (3 x ) 3   "   y 3
 
(ii) 64 x 3   !  125 y 3   #  (4 x ) 3   !  (5 y ) 3 .
Also
x 3   !   y 3   #   ( x   !   y )( x 2   "   xy   "   y 2 )
x 3  "   y 3   #   ( x   "   y )( x 2   !   xy   "   y 2 )
( ax ) 3   !  ( by ) 3   #   ( ax   !   by )( a 2 x 2   "   abxy   "   b 2 y 2 )
( ax ) 3  "  ( by ) 3   #   ( ax   "   by )( a 2 x 2   !   abxy   "   b 2 y 2 )
x 2   "   xy   "   y 2
x   !   y    ) !

So, in general when dealing with algebraic fractions;
 (i) A common denominator is needed to add or subtract fractions.
 (ii)  A fraction can be reduced (simpliﬁed) only if the numerator and denominator 
have a common factor.
 (iii)  If the denominator or numerator contain fractions added or subtracted, they 
must be reduced into a single fraction ﬁrst before proceeding. 
 (iv) To divide fractions, we multiply by the denominator inverted.

Section 1.5  Binomial Expansions   
We expand ( a   "   b ) 2  as  a 2   "  2 ab  "   b 2 .
Also ( a   "   b ) 3  = ( a   "   b )( a   "   b ) 2   #  ( a   "   b )( a 2   "  2 ab   "   b 2 )
=  a 3   "  2 a 2 b   "   ab 2   "   a 2 b   "  2 ab 2   "   b 3
=  a 3   "  3 a 2 b   "  3 ab 2   "   b 3
However with higher powers this method is too time consuming.
Examining a number of expansions the following patterns are noted:
( a   "   b ) 2   #  1 a 2   "   2 ab   "  1 b 2  
( a   "   b ) 3   #  1 a 3   "   3 a 2 b   "   3 ab 2   "  1 b 3
( a   "   b ) 4   #  1 a 4   "   4 a 3 b   "   6 a 2 b 2   "   4 ab 3   "  1 b 4
( a   "   b ) 5   #   1 a 5   "   5 a 4 b  +  10 a 3 b 2   "   10 a 2 b 3   "   5 ab 4   "   1 b 5

1.  The powers of  a  decrease by 1 from term to term,  a 5 ,  a 4 ,  a 3 ,  a 2 ,  a .
 
2.  The powers of  b  increase by 1 from term to term  b ,  b 2 ,  b 3 ,  b 4 ,  b 5
 
3.  The sum of the powers of  a  and  b  for each term is 5,  a 4 b 1 ,  a 3 b 2 ,  a 2 b 3 ,  a 1 b 4 .
 
4.  The number of terms in each expansion is 1 greater than the power.
 
 i.e. ( a   "   b ) 3  has 4 terms, ( a   "   b ) 4  has 5 terms, ( a   "   b ) 5  has 6 terms etc.
 
5.  The coefﬁcients form Pascal’s triangle.

The coefﬁcients can be expressed in terms of combinations (see Chapter 5 - Probability)
where   ( !   n  
      r   )   stands for the number of ways of choosing  r  objects from  n  different objects.
So ( a   "   b ) 5   #    ( !   5  
      0  )   a 5   "    ( !   5  
     1  )   a 4 b   "    ( !   5  
      2  )   a 3 b 2   "    ( !   5  
      3  )   a 2 b 3  +   ( !   5  
      4  )   ab 4  +   ( !   5  
      5  )   b 5
All of the coefﬁcients can be quickly evaluated using a calculator with an  nCr  function.
For example   ( !   5  
      4  )  , press 5   nCr   4   #   5 and   ( !   9  
      3  )  , press 9   nCr   3   #   84
In general we can write,
( a   "   b ) n   #    ( !   n  
     
0   )   a n   "    ( !   n 
     
1   )   a n  !   1 b  "    ( !   n 
     
2   )   a n  !  2 b 2   "    ( !   n 
     
3   )   a n  !  3 b 3   "  … where the  general term  of this  
expansion is written as,   ( !   n  
      r   )  a n  !   r b r .

When calculating binomial coefﬁcients we note that:
 
1.    ( !   n  
     
0   )   #    ( !   n 
     
n   )   #  1, for all values of  n  #   N
 
2.    ( !   n  
     
1   )  =  n , for all values of  n   #   N
 
3.    ( !   n  
      r   )   =   ( !   n  
            
n   !   r   )   for all values of  n   #   N   i.e.    ( !  6 
      4  )   #    ( !   6  
      2  )  and   ( !   8  
      7  )   #    ( !   8  
      1  )  
 
4.   Since the binomial coefﬁcients start with   ( !   n  
     
0   )  , the 3rd coefﬁcient is given by   ( !   n 
     
2    )  
The binomial theorem gives a quick and efﬁcient way to expand any binomial to a given power.
The formula for the theorem is given on page 20 of the  Formulae and Tables  booklet.

Section 1.6  Algebraic identities   
The word identity occurs  
in many different areas of  
mathematics. It is used in  
trigonometry, in sets,  
in functions and in algebra.
If 3 x   "  7  #   ax   "   b   for all values of  x , this is called an  algebraic identity .
We can conclude that for this to be true, then  a   #  3 and  b   #  7.
When two expressions are equal  for all values of  x , then the resulting equation is an identity. 
All coefﬁcients of like powers of  x  in an identity are equal.
In an  identity,  all coefﬁcients of like powers are equal.
An identity must be true  for all values  of the 
independent variable.

--- Page 23 ---

Generally, if  ax 3   "   bx 2   "   cx   "   d   #   px 3   "   qx 2   "   rx   "   s  for all values of  x , 
then  a   #   p ,  b   #   q ,  c   #   r ,  d   #   s .
Also, if  ax 3   "   bx 2   "   cx   "   d   #   qx 2   "   s  for all values of  x , 
then  a   #   c   #  0 and  b   #   q ,  d   #   s .
This property is used to ﬁnd unknown coefﬁcients in certain equations.
Algebraic identities can also be used to create  partial fractions  from a given fraction.
For example,  
1  
_____________  
 
( x   "  1)( x   !  2)   #   
A  
_______  
( x   "  1)   "   
B  
_______  
( x   !  2)  where  A  and  B   #   Q .

Algebraic identities and factors  
If  x 2   !   ax   "   b  is a factor of  x 3   "  2 ax 2   "  4 bx   "   c ,  
using  algebraic identities  we can ﬁnd a relationship between the coefﬁcients  a ,  b  and  c .
It is important to realise that when a factor is divided into an expression, there can be no 
remainder by deﬁnition of a factor. 
x   "  3 a 
Since there can be no remainder, we
x 2   !   ax   "   b    ) !
__________________  
 
x 3   "  2 ax 2   "  4 bx   "   c 
can conclude that  for all values of  x ,
x 3   !   ax 2   "   bx 
  (i) 3 b   "  3 a 2   #  0, i.e.  b   #   ! a 2  and
3 ax 2   "  3 bx   "   c
3 ax 2   !  3 a 2 x   "  3 ab 
(ii)  c   !  3 ab   #  0, i.e.  c   #  3 ab
Remainder  #   x (3 b   "  3 a 2 )  "   c   !  3 ab
The same results can be obtained by letting the missing factor  #  ( x   "   k ).
!  ( x   "   k )( x 2   !   ax   "   b )  #   x 3   "  2 ax 2   "  4 bx   "   c
Expanding the left-hand side we get,
x 3   !   ax 2   "   bx   "   kx 2   !   akx   "   bk   #   x 3   "  2 ax 2   "  4 bx   "   c  …  for all values of   x .

Section 1.7  Manipulating formulae   
The area of a disc is given by the formula  A   #   % r 2 .
A  is said to be deﬁned  in terms of  r  ( r  is the independent  
variable).
If we know  r , we can ﬁnd  A.
For example, if  r   #  3, then  A   #  9 %  ; if  r  #  8, then  A   #  64 % , etc. .
In some cases we may need to ﬁnd  r  in terms  A , i.e. make  r  the  subject  of the equation.
!   % r 2   #   A   ⇒   r 2   #    A  
__  
%    ⇒   r   #    √

  A

%    …  r  is now deﬁned in terms of  A . 
Thus, if we know the area of the circle, we can ﬁnd the radius. 
For example, if  A   #  9 % , then  r   #    √

  A

Section 1.8  Algebraic patterns, an introduction   
1. Linear   Each polynomial function creates a pattern 
which can be studied both numerically  
and graphically.
Patterns such as 0, 3, 6, 9, … can be described by  
the function 
f  ( x )  #  (  y )  #  3 x , where  x   )  0,  x  #  N .
Patterns such as 1, 4, 7, 10, … can be described by  
the function 
f  ( x )  #  (  y )  #  3 x   "  1, where  x   )  0,  x  #  N .
Patterns such as 2,  ! 2,  ! 6,  ! 10 … can be described by  
the function
f  ( x )  #  (  y )  #  2  !  4 x , where  x   )  0,  x  #  N .
Each of these number patterns has a constant amount  
added or subtracted between terms and each, when  
graphed, produces a straight line as shown. 
Functions of the form  f  ( x )  #   y   #   mx   "   c  are  
called  linear  functions.

2. Quadratic   Patterns such as 0, 1, 4, 9, 16 … do not have a constant amount added or 
subtracted between terms.  
Studying the 1st differences between terms, we get 1, 3, 5, 7, … . 
The  2nd difference  (3   !  1), (5   !  3), … however is a constant, 2. 
Such patterns can be represented by the function  f  ( x )  #  (  y )  #   x 2  for   x   )  0.
Functions of the form  f  ( x )  $   x 2   "   b  create similar patterns.

The starting point 
of each pattern 
determines  c , the 
constant term.  
We note that when  
x   #  0, geometrically, 
we get the  y -axis 
intercept,  c .

--- Page 33 ---

As can be seen from the graphs, the curves are symmetrical 
about the line  x   #  0 ( y -axis).
Patterns of the form  f ( x )  #   x 2   "   b  are  % -shaped.
Patterns of the form  f ( x )  #   b   !  x 2  are  & -shaped.
Consider the following pattern.

Because the 2nd difference is a constant, we know this  
is a quadratic pattern of the form 
ax 2   "   bx   "   c ,  x   )   0,  x  #   N .
When  x   #  0,  ax 2   "   bx   "   c   #  4,  !   c   #  4
When  x   #  1,  ax 2   "   bx   "  4  #  7,  !   a   "   b   "  4  #  7
When  x   #  2,  ax 2   "   bx   "  4  #  16,  !   4 a   "  2 b  "  4  #  16
Solving we ﬁnd  a   #  3,  b   #  0
Thus the pattern can be represented by the polynomial function  f  ( x )  #  3 x 2   "  4.
More complex quadratic patterns of the form  ax 2   "   bx   "   c  can be formed in two stages;  
ﬁrst to identify the quadratic element  x 2 , then subtracting this from the pattern to form the 
linear element  bx "   c .

Section 1.9  Solving equations   
To solve an equation, we need to ﬁnd the values of the given variable that satisfy the equation.
If 4 x   !  12  #  0, then  x   #  3 is the only solution of this equation.
If  x 2   !  5 x   "  6  #  0, then  x   #  2 and  x   #  3 are both solutions of this equation.
If  y   #  4 x   !  12, then ( x, y )  #  (4, 4) is one of the many values of ( x, y ) that satisfy this equation.

--- Page 36 ---

Given  f  ( x )  #  4 x   !  12,  
then  x   #  3 is the value that makes  f  ( x )  #   0.
Therefore, ( x, y )  #  (3, 0) is the solution  
of  y   #  4 x   !  12.
Similarly, (2, 0) and (3, 0) are solutions  
of  y  #  x 2   !  5 x   "  6.
The values of  x  that make  y  #  0  
are called the  roots  of an equation.
If a graph of the function is plotted, the roots  
are those points where the graph crosses the  x -axis.
Solving linear equations  
Any equation of the form  y   $  a x   "  b , when plotted, creates a straight line. 
Such equations are called  linear equations .
To solve the equation 2 x   "  1  #  0, we need to ﬁnd the value of  x  that makes  y   #  0, i.e. where 
the line crosses the  x -axis.
2 x   "  1  #  0
⇒   x   #    ! 1  
___  
2    #   ! 0.5
Similarly, to solve the equation 2 x   "  1  #  2, we have  
to ﬁnd the value of  x  that makes  y   #  2, i.e. where the  
line crosses the line  y   #  2.
2 x   "  1  #  2
⇒   x   #    1  
__   2  #  0.5
In each case, there is only one value of  x  (one root)  
produced.

Section 1.10  Solving simultaneous linear equations   
1. Solving simultaneous linear equations with two variables
The linear equation  y   #    2   _  
3   x   !  3 can be rearranged  
as follows: 
 
y   #    2   _  
3   x   !  3
 
3 y   #  2 x   !  9 
 2 x   !  3 y   !  9  #  0  is the equation of the same  
line, expressed in standard form.
Standard form of the equation 
of a line:
ax   "   by   "   c   #  0

--- Page 38 ---

38
This equation has two variables ( x, y ) for which there  
are many solutions. 
However, if we have two equations in  x  and  y , they  
are either 
(a) parallel, with no point of intersection or
(b) they intersect at a point ( x 1 , y 1 ), common to  
both lines.
In this diagram, the lines 2 x   !   y   " 1  #  0 and  
3 x   "   y   !  4  #  0 are plotted.
They have a point of intersection A( x, y )  #    ( !   3   _  
5   ,   11  
__  
5     )  which  
satisﬁes both equations at the same time, i.e. simultaneously.
We can solve two linear equations (i.e. ﬁnd their point of intersection) by: 
    (i) substitution
  (ii) elimination
(iii) graphically (as above).
Note 1:   The technique for solving equations by substitution will be used later to ﬁnd the 
point(s) of intersection of a line and a curve.
Note 2:   Either variable can be substituted.  
(Always choose the variable that is easiest to isolate.)

2. Solving simultaneous equations with three variables
x  "   y   "   z   #  6 is an equation with three variables (three dimensions). 
To plot this equation we need three axes,  x ,  y  and  z -axes, at right angles to one another. 
When plotted, this equation represents a plane of points. 
If three planes are plotted on the same axes, there will be one point of intersection  
( x, y, z ,) provided none of the planes are parallel.

To solve an equation with three unknowns, 
 
(i) reduce the three equations to two by eliminating one of the unknowns 
 
(ii) choose an unknown that is easy to isolate
 
(iii) eliminate this unknown from all three equations, taking them two at a time
 
(iv) solve these two equations as before 
 
(v)  use your values for these unknowns in one of the original equations to solve for  
the third unknown
 
(vi) check your solutions in all equations.

Section 2.1  Quadratic equations   
As mentioned already, when the highest power of a variable in a polynomial is two, the 
resulting expression is called a quadratic expression. 
The following are examples of quadratic equations:
(i) 3 x 2   !  4 x   "  5  #  0   (ii) 6  #  3 t   ! 8 t 2    (iii)  A   #  2 $ rh   !  2 $ r 2
Each quadratic equation has two solutions (or roots). 
Solving quadratic equations
Techniques for solving quadratic equations include
(i) factorising  (ii) quadratic formula  (iii) graphical methods  (iv) substitution.
(i) Factorising methods (as in Chapter 1)
If an equation which equates to zero can  
be factorised, then at least one of its  
factors must equal zero.
If  ( a )( b )  !  0,  then  a   !  0  or  b   !  0 .

(ii) Quadratic formula
The quadratic formula  x   #    " b   %    √
________  
b 2   "  4 ac   
 
_______________  
2 a  
 can be 
used to solve any quadratic equation of the form  
ax 2   !   bx   !   c   #  0.
It is good practice to write out the coefﬁcients  a ,  b , and  c  separately before applying  
the formula.
(iii) Graphical methods
Graphing the expression  y   #   x 2   "  5 x   ! 1, 0  &   x   &  5,  
we get the points  
(0, 1), (1,  " 3), (2,  " 5), (3,  " 5), (4,  " 3), (5, 1),  
which, when plotted, produce the familiar  
" -shaped curve.
To solve  y   #   x 2   "  5 x   !  1  #  0 graphically,  
we must ﬁnd the points on the curve  
where  y   #  0, i.e. the points G(0.2, 0) and H(4.8, 0).
!  The roots are 0.2 and 4.8.

When the expression  y   #   " x 2   "  3 x   ! 2 is plotted,  
a  # -shaped graph results. 
Again, the roots of the equation  
" x 2   "  3 x   !  2  #  0 occur where the curve  
intersects the  x -axis (i.e. where  y   #  0),  
i.e. the points G( " 3.6, 0) and H(0.6, 0).
Graphical methods can only give  
approximate values for the roots of  
an equation.
To solve the equation  " x 2   "  3 x   ! 2  #  3, we can consider two approaches;
 (i) To ﬁnd the points on the curve  y   #   " x 2   "  3 x   ! 2 where  y   #  3 (i.e. S, P)  or
 (ii)  To create the new curve  y   #   " x 2   "  3 x   !  2  "  3  #   " x 2   "  3 x   "  1 and solve  
" x 2   "  3 x   "  1  #  0. 
Both are different curves but with the same solutions (roots) for Q and S,  x   "   " 2.6 and 
for P and R,  x  "  0.4.
(iv) Substitution
The following types of equations can be solved by choosing a suitable substitution which 
creates a new quadratic equation in standard form.

 to solve quadratic equations of 
the form  ax 2   !   bx   !   c   #  0, where  a ,  b ,  c   $   R .
The value of the expression ( b 2   "  4 ac ) will  
determine the nature of the roots of this equation  
and is called the  discriminant  of the equation.

In summary
 
1. If ( b 2   "  4 ac )  (  0  ⇒  two different (distinct) real roots
2. If ( b 2   "  4 ac )  #  0  ⇒  two equal real roots
3. If ( b 2   "  4 ac )  )  0  ⇒  two imaginary roots
4. If ( b 2   "  4 ac ) is a perfect square  →  rational roots
Note:   When the phrase “has  real roots ” is used in questions, then this must be taken to 
mean “has  either  two real distinct roots  or  two equal (repeated) roots”.

Section 2.3  Solving quadratic and linear equations   
To ﬁnd the point(s) of intersection  
between a line and a curve, we  
use the technique of  substitution . 
We have used this method already  
when solving simultaneous linear  
equations.
We note that in this case, the line  
may 
 (i)  intersect the curve at two  
points
 (ii) intersect at one point
 (iii)  or not intersect the curve  
at all.
If there is just one point of intersection, the line is said to be a  tangent  to the curve.
The line  x   "   y   #   " 1 intersects the curve  y   #   x 2   !  5 x   !  1 at two points, A( " 4,  " 3) and B(0, 1).
The line   x   "   y   #  3 is a tangent to the curve  y   #   x 2   ! 5 x   ! 1 at the point E( " 2,  " 5). 
The line  x   "   y   #  5 does not intersect the curve.

In summary,  to ﬁnd the point(s) of intersection between a line and a curve,
 (i) isolate one of the variables in the equation of the line, e.g.  y  #  ax  !   b .
 (ii)  Substitute this expression for  y  into the equation for the curve  y  #  cx 2   !  dx  !  e ,  
i.e.  ax  ! b  #   cx 2   !  dx  !  e  and simplify.
 (iii) Solve the resulting quadratic equation.

Section 2.4  Quadratic and linear equations in context   
Algebraic methods can be used to solve many real-life problems.  
If we can represent an unknown or variable with a symbol, and write the relationship 
between the variables in the form of a linear or quadratic equation, then the resulting 
equations can be solved using the techniques discussed earlier.

Section 2.5   Forming quadratic equations from  
their roots   
If we know the roots of an equation, we can ﬁnd the equation by 
 
(i) ﬁnding the factors of the equation
 (ii) multiplying the factors to get the equation.
Generally, if we let  x   #   r 1  and  x   #   r 2  be the roots of a quadratic equation, 
then ( x   "   r 1 ) and ( x   "   r 2 ) are the factors  
and ( x   "   r 1 )( x   "   r 2 )  #  0 is the equation. 
i.e.  x 2   "   xr 2  "   xr 1   !   r 1 r 2   #  0
x 2   "   x ( r 2  !   r 1 )  !   r 1 r 2  #  0. 
Given  r 1  ,   r 2  as the roots of an equation, then the equation is 
x 2   "   x ( r 1  !   r 2 )  !   r 1 r 2  #  0, 
i.e.  x 2   "   x  (sum of the roots)  !  product of the roots   #  0.

Section 2.6  Max and Min of Quadratic graphs   
The quadratic expression  x 2   "  6 x   !  11 can be rewritten as 
x 2   "  6 x   &  9  %  9   !  11 
#  ( x   "  3)( x   "  3)  "  9  !  11  #  ( x   "  3) 2   !  2.
!   x 2   "  6 x   !  11  #  ( x   "  3) 2   !  2.
This is called  completing the square . 
This form of a quadratic expression can give us very useful information about the behaviour  
of the quadratic function.
 (i)  Maximum or minimum values.
At  x   #  3, ( x   "  3)  #  0. 
!  ( x   "  3) 2   !  2  #  2 is the minimum  
value of this expression. 
 (ii)  Real or complex roots.
Let ( x   "  3) 2   !  2  #  0 to ﬁnd the roots. 
Then ( x   "  3) 2   #   " 2
x   "  3  #   %    √
___
 
" 2 
x   #  3  %    √

  (iii)  Values of  x  which make the function   positive   or negative.
( x   "  3) 2  is positive for all  x  $  R .  
!  ( x   "  3) 2   !  2 is positive for all  x   $   R . 
 (iv)  Each graph has a  turning point  which is the maximum or minimum point of the graph.
 (v) Each graph has an  axis of symmetry  parallel to the  y -axis through this point.
 (vi) The graph of a quadratic function is called a  parabola.

Generally, to complete the square of expressions  
of the form  x 2   !  b x   !  c,  add and subtract  
(half the coefﬁcient of  x ) 2  to the expression  
and isolate the perfect square portion.
i.e.  x 2   !   bx   !   c   #   x 2   !   bx   !    ( #   b  
__  
2   )

Note:   If the coefﬁcient of  x 2  is not 1, the  x 2  coefﬁcient must be factored out before 
proceeding, e.g.,
 (i)  x 2   !  2 x   !  5   #   x 2   !  2 x   &  1  %  1   !  5 
#  ( x   !  1) 2   !  4 
 (ii) 4  "  2 x   "   x 2   #  4  "  ( x 2   !  2 x )   #  4  "  ( x 2   !  2 x   &  1  %  1 )  #  4  "  [( x   !  1) 2   "  1]  
#  5  "  ( x   !  1) 2  
 (iii) 3 x 2   "  3 x   !  2  #  3( x 2   "   x   !    2   _

All quadratic expressions  
( ax 2   !   bx   !  c) can be  
written in the form of 
a ( x   "   p ) 2   !   q ,  a  " -shaped

⇒   a ( x   "   p ) 2   !   q  #  0  !  q  #   q , the minimum value.
Similarly, a quadratic equation in the form  q   "   a ( x   "   p ) 2  has a  maximum point  at (  p ,  q ) and 
a maximum value  q  at the point  x   #   p .
When quadratic expressions can be written as  a ( x   "   p ) 2   !   q,  there is a  minimum   
point (  p ,  q ). When quadratic expressions can be written as  q   "   a ( x   "   p ) 2 , there is a 
maximum  point (  p ,  q ).

Section 2.8  Algebraic surd equations   
Expressions such as   √
______  
2 x   !  1 occur often in algebra. 
To solve the equation   √
______  
2 x   !  1  #  5, we proceed as follows.
 (  √
______  
2 x   !  1 ) 2   #  5 2   … squaring both sides to remove the square root
 
2 x   !  1  #  25
 
2 x   #  24
 
⇒   x   #  12
Note:   With surds, it is important to check all solutions in the original equation as some  
may result in complex (non-real) solutions. 
At  x   #  12,   √
______  
2 x   !  1  #    √
________

25  #  5, which is correct.

--- Page 75 ---

•  If there is  only one surd , isolate it on one side and then square both sides and solve.
•  If there are  two surds , move one to each side of the equation. Square both sides and 
isolate any remaining surds. Square both sides again to remove any remaining surd.
•  Solve the resulting equation.
•  Check your answers in the original equation.

Section 2.9  The factor theorem   
In Chapter 1 we revised techniques for factorising algebraic expressions. 
The factor theorem is a more general technique that can be applied to expressions  
of higher orders.
Using long division, we can divide  f  ( x )  #   x 3   !  3 x 2   "  4 x   "  12 by  x   !  3 as before.
x 2   "  4 
x   !  3   ) #
__________________  
 
  x 3   !  3 x 2   "  4 x   "  12 
!   f  ( x )  #   x 3   !  3 x 2   "  4 x   "  12  #  ( x 2   "  4)( x   !  3).
x 3   !  3 x 2
" 4 x   "  12 
!  the factors of  f  ( x ) are ( x 2   "  4) and ( x   !  3). 
" 4 x   "  12 
no remainder 
!  the roots of  f  ( x ) are ( x   !  3)  #  0  ⇒   x   #   " 3 
and ( x 2   "  4)  #  0  ⇒   x   #   % 2. 
Evaluating the function at  x   #   " 3,  ! 2,  " 2 ; 
f  ( " 3)  #  ( " 3) 3   !  3( " 3) 2   "  4( " 3)  "  12  #  0
f  ( " 2)  #  ( " 2) 3   !  3( " 2) 2   "  4( " 2)  "  12  #  0
f  (2)  #  (2) 3   !  3(2) 2   "  4(2)  "  12  #  0 , as we would expect of every root.

--- Page 78 ---

Generalising this for every polynomial  f  ( x ) ; if  f  ( k )  #  0, then  x   "   k  is a factor.
Conversely, if  x   "   k  is a factor, then  f  ( k )  #  0.
The Factor Theorem:
If  f  ( k )  #  0, then ( x   "   k ) is a factor.
Conversely, if ( x   "   k ) is a factor, then  f  ( k )  #  0.
Also, if ( ax   "   k ) is a factor, then  f    ( #   k  
__  
a   )   #  0.

1. Factorising cubic expressions
We can now use the  factor theorem  to factorise higher-order polynomials,  
e.g. cubic polynomials of the form  f  ( x )  #   ax 3   !   bx 2   !   cx   !   d  that have at  
least one integer root.
Using trial and error, we evaluate  f  (0),  f  (1),  f  ( " 1),  f  (2),  f  ( " 2),  f  (3) … etc., until we get a 
value of zero.
This is the integer root.
If  f  ( " 2)  #  0, then ( x   !  2) is a factor.
If  f  (3)  #  0, then ( x   "  3) is a factor.
Dividing by this factor produces a quadratic expression which can be factorised 
separately using factor pairs or using the quadratic formula.
2. Solving cubic equations
To solve cubic equations of the form  f  ( x )  #   ax 3   !   bx 2   !   cx   !   d   #  0, we ﬁrst ﬁnd 
the factors as in the above example and then equate each factor to zero to ﬁnd the 
roots(solutions).

Section 2.10   Graphs of cubic (and higher order)
polynomials   
The coefﬁcients of a cubic polynomial  f ( x )  #   ax 3   !   bx 2
  !   cx   !   d  determine the ﬁnal shape 
of each graph. Some important features need to be noted and emphasised. 
ICT:  Input  each of the following functions using a graphics calculator or computer 
software (e.g. Geogebra). Examine the effect of changing coefﬁcients on the shape  
of each graph. 
Note:   The factor form of each function is very suitable in some cases.

1. Three real roots
f  ( x )  #  2 x 3   "  4 x 2   "  22 x   !  24 
f  ( x )  #  ( x   "  1)(2 x   !  6)( x  "  4) 
This graph has three real roots,  
" 3, 1, 4.
As the graph passes through a  
root, the value of the function  
changes from  
( " ) ve  to ( ! ) ve  or ( ! ) ve  to ( " ) ve .
The graph has two turning points,  
a local maximum and a local  
minimum.
2. Three real roots, two of which repeat
f  ( x )   #   x 3   "   x 2   "  8 x   !  12  
#  ( x   !  3)( x   "  2) 2
This graph again has three real roots,  " 3, 2, 2,  
but one of the roots is repeated.
This graph only crosses the  x -axis once  
because of the repeated root.
The graph has two turning points. 
3. One real, two non-real roots
f  ( x )   #   x 3   "  2 x   "  4

4. Comparing  f  ( x )  !   x 3   %  3 x 2   &  2 x  and  g  ( x )  !  2 x 3   %  6 x 2   &  4 x   !  2 f  ( x )
Both polynomials have  
the same roots,  x   #  0, 1, 2.
!  the polynomials have  
common factors ( x ),  
( x   "  1) and ( x   "  2).
But  g ( x ) has an integer  
factor 2 as well that  
multiplies each value  
of the curve, except  
where the value is zero  
at the roots.
This integer factor acts  
as an ampliﬁcation factor.
5. Comparing  f  ( x )  !   x 3   %  3 x 2   &  2 x  and  g  ( x )  !   % x 3   &  3 x 2   %  2 x   !   % f  ( x )
Again, both  
polynomials have  
the same roots  
and hence  
common factors.
The graphs are  
symmetrical  
across the  
x -axis.
g ( x )  #   " x 3   !  3 x 2   "  2 x   #   "  ( x 3   "  3 x 2   !  2 x )  #   " f  ( x ).
Multiplying by a minus inverts the graph.
6. The graphs of  f  ( x )  !   ax 3
All the graphs pass through (0, 0).
For  a  (  0, the graphs are all increasing, and as  
a  increases, the graphs rise more steeply.
For  a  )  0, the graphs are decreasing.
Note:
 (i)  If  f  ( x )  #  3 x 3  and  g ( x )  #   " 3 x 3 ,  
⇒   f  ( x )  #   " g ( x ),  i.e.  f  ( x ) is the reﬂection of  g ( x )

Note:   There are no local maximum or minimum points as in the previous  
graphs.
Summary:
 (i)  Every cubic polynomial crosses the  x -axis at least once, i.e. has one  
real root.
 (ii) Each root produces a factor of the polynomial.
 (iii)  If a polynomial has a repeated root with an even power e.g. ( x   "  2) 2 , ( x   "  3) 4  etc.,  
then the graph touches, but does cross, the  x -axis at these points.
 (iv)  If the coefﬁcient of  x 3  is positive, the graph starts below the  x -axis,  
i.e. starts with a negative  y -value and increases with increasing  x -values.
 (v)  If the coefﬁcient of  x 3  is negative, the graph starts above the  x -axis,  
i.e. starts with a positive  y -value and decreases with increasing  x -values.
 (vi) Some cubic graphs have local maximum and minimum turning points.
 (vii) When forming a polynomial from its roots, check for an integer factor.

Section 3.1  Radian measure   
In your study of geometry and trigonometry so far, you will have worked with angles which 
were measured in degrees. One complete revolution is 360°. However, in more advanced 
trigonometry and calculus, angles are almost always measured in  radians .
The diagram on the right shows an arc AB equal in length to  
the radius,  r .
The measure of  ∠ AOB is said to be 1 radian.
If the length of the arc AB was 2 r , then  |∠ AOB |  would be 2 radians.
Radian   
Since the circumference of a circle is 2 ! r , i.e., 2 !  times the radius,  
then there are 2 !  radians in one complete revolution.
⇒  2 !  radians  "  360°

cos    and  
tan  keys on an electronic calculator to ﬁnd the sine, cosine and
tangent of any angle.
To ﬁnd sin 35°, key in 
sin  35

The result is 0.573576…  "  0.5736, correct to 4 decimal places.
Parts of a degree
A degree can be divided into 60 parts.
Each part is called 1  minute , written 1 % .
Thus 34.5°  "  34°30 % .
To ﬁnd tan 34.5° or 34°30 %  on your calculator, you may use either of these methods:
1.  For tan 34.5° 
2.  For tan 34°30 %

If we are given that sin  A   "  0.8661, we can ﬁnd the angle  A  by using the 
sin & 1    key.
The 
sin & 1    key is got by keying in

The result is 60.008°  "  60°.
Similarly, if tan  B   "  1.2734, we ﬁnd the angle  B  by keying in

Section 3.4  Sine Rule – Area of a triangle   
In this section dealing with the sides and angles of any triangle, 
we will use the usual notation  A ,  B  and  C  to denote the angles 
and  a ,  b  and  c  to denote the sides opposite these angles.
In your study of trigonometry so far, you will have used the 
Theorem of Pythagoras to ﬁnd sides and angles of a right-
angled triangle.
In order to deal with any triangle, we will establish the ﬁrst of two very important 
relationships between the angles and sides of the triangle.
This rule is known as the  sine rule .
1. The Sine Rule:    a

Using the sine rule   
To use the sine rule to solve a triangle, we need to know one side 
and the angle opposite this side as well as one other angle or side.

Caution!
In a  △ ABC,  | AC |   "  4 cm,  | BC |   "  6 cm and  |∠ ABC |   "  30°.

There are two possible positions for vertex A, namely A 1  and A 2 .
This situation arises when we are given two sides and a non-included angle.
When two possible triangles can be drawn, it is generally referred to as the  ambiguous case .
 In the triangle above,  |∠ BA 1 C |   "  48.6° and  |∠ BA 2 C |   "  180°  &  48.6°
 
  "  131.4°

Section 3.5  The Cosine rule   
In the given triangle, we are given the lengths of the three sides  
but no angle. We cannot use the sine rule here to ﬁnd the angle A.
Instead we use another rule for solving triangles.
It is called the  cosine rule .
The cosine rule states that for any triangle,
a 2   "   b 2   #   c 2   $   2 bc  cos A.
The Cosine Rule:   a 2   "   b 2   #   c 2   $ 2 bc  cos A
To prove the Cosine Rule  a 2   "   b 2   #   c 2   $   2 bc  cos A
Draw triangle with vertex  A  at the origin,  B ( c , 0) and  
point C making an obtuse angle with A.
Draw a circle of radius length  b  with centre at A.
Since the coordinates of any point on a unit circle 
can be written as (cos  # , sin  # ), the coordinates of C  
can now be written as  C ( b  cos  A, b  sin  A ).
| BC |   "   a  and  | BC |  is the distance from ( c,  0) to

⇒   a 2   "   b 2   (   c  2   &  2 bc  cos  A
Similarly it may be proved that
b 2   "   a 2   (   c  2   &  2 ac  cos  B  and  c  2   "   a 2   (   b  2   &  2 ab  cos  C.

Section 3.6  Problems in three dimensions   
In this section you will deal with trigonometric problems in three dimensions.
One of the ﬁrst things you are required to do is to identify which angles or which lengths 
you need to calculate. For this reason it is of the utmost importance that you sketch good 
diagrams.
Most problems in three dimensions consist of a series of connected triangles. It is important 
to identify right-angled triangles in particular. If we require an angle or length in a particular 
triangle, it simpliﬁes the work if the triangle is drawn separately.  
From this point on you can work from a two-dimensional ﬁgure,  
just as you have been doing so far in this chapter.
In this cube there are many connected right-angled 
triangles.
The triangle HED can be used to ﬁnd the length of  
the side [HD].
The side [HD] can be used in the triangle AHD to  
ﬁnd  | AD |  and  |∠ ADH | .

Note:   If a triangle is not right-angled, we use the sine rule or the cosine rule to ﬁnd an 
unknown angle or unknown side.

Section 3.7  Graphs of trigonometric functions   
Graph of  y   "  sin  x
Consider a point A on a unit circle.

As the point moves around the circle, the angle increases from 0 to 2 !  radians (0° to 360°).
At the same time the  y -coordinate of A changes from 0 to 1 to 0 to  & 1 to 0.
By measuring the length of the opposite ( y ) and the angle ( x ) contained, a set of ordered 
pairs ( x ,  y ) is created. When plotted these points all lie on a smooth curve,  y  = sin  x .

y   = sin   x
It is also clear that the point can continue to rotate making larger angles but the  y -value 
continues to repeat within a  range  of values [ & 1, 1]. 
This function,  y   "  sin  x , is therefore said to be  periodic . 
The shortest measurement along the  x -axis after which it repeats is the  period  of the function. 
The period of  y   "  sin  x  is 360° or 2 !  radians.
The  period  of a function,  f , is a positive number  a  such 
that  f  ( x   (   a )  "   f  ( x ).
The period of sin( x ) is 2 !  as sin( x   (  2 ! )  "  sin( x ).

As  x  increases further (past 90°),  
the adjacent side becomes negative  
and decreases in value to  & 1. 
The cosine graph repeats after

Section 3.8  Related trigonometric graphs   
The main features of trigonometric graphs are:
(a)   Range:  the interval on the  y -axis from the lowest  
to the highest value.
(b)   Midline:  a horizontal line which lies halfway  
between the highest and lowest points.
(c)   Amplitude:  the distance between the midline  
and the maximum or minimum values of the graph. 
(d)   Period:  the shortest distance along the  x -axis after  
which the graph repeats itself.

1. Changes to the amplitude,  y  "   b  sin  x
For  y   "  2 sin  x  every value of sin  x  is multiplied by 2,  
the graph stretches in the  y  direction by a factor of 2.  
The amplitude is now 2.
The  amplitude  of  y   "   b  sin  x  is  | b | .
The period does not change, however, the range changes  
from [ & 1, 1] to [ & 2, 2].
The range of  y   "  sin  x  is [ & 1, 1]
The range of  y   "   b  sin  x  is [ & | b | ,  | b | ]
Similarly  y  =  b  cos  x  has an amplitude of  | b |  and a range  
of [ & | b | ,  | b | ]
If  b   "   & 1 then the graphs,  y   "   & sin  x  and  y   "   & cos  x  are reﬂections in the  x -axis of

3. Graphs of the form,  y   "   a   #   b  sin ( cx ) and  y   "   a   #   b  cos ( cx )
The graph of  y   "  1  (  cos  x  is obtained from the  
graph of  y   "  cos  x  by a translation of 1 unit in the  
positive direction of the  y -axis.
Adding 1 unit to  y   "  cos  x  does not change the  
period or the amplitude of the function.
Adding 1 unit does change the maximum and  
minimum values of the function and so  
changes the range.
It therefore changes the mid-line as well.
The mid-line of  y   "  1  (  cos  x  is  y   "  1
The range of  y   "  cos  x  is [ & 1, 1]
The range of  y   "  1 + cos  x  is [0, 2] 
The range of  y  =  & 1 + cos  x  is [ & 2, 0]
In general for graphs of the form,

Section 3.9   General solutions of trigonometric  
equations   
In Section 3.3 we solved equations such as sin  x   "      √

___  
2   for angles in the range 0  *   x   *  360°  
(or 0  *   x   *  2 ! ).
This generally gave us two values for the angle  x .
Consider again the equation cos  #   "    1   _  
2   .
A calculator in degree mode gives an answer of 60°.
But recall that this is only the principal value.
Check that  #   "  300° and  #   "  420° also work.
The equation cos  #   "    1   _  
2   has no restriction on the set of values of  #  that are solutions.

--- Page 136 ---

The graph below shows the function  y   "  cos  #  and the function  y   "    1   _

The graph shows that there is an inﬁnite number of solutions to the equation cos  #   "    1   _

In the range 0°  *   #   *  360°, there are two values of  #  for which cos  #   "    1   _  
2   .
These value are 60° and 300°.
Notice that the value  #   "  420° is 60°  (  360° and  #   "  660° is 300°  (  360°.
Thus further solutions of the equation are found by repeatedly adding 360° to the angles 60° 
and 300°.
So the solutions to the equation cos  #   "    1   _  
2   are 
#   "  60°  (   n 360° or  #   "  300°  (   n 360°, where  n  is an integer.
This is called the  general solution  of the equation.
We can ﬁnd the general solution of any trigonometric equation in the form sin  #   "   k  or cos  #   "   k   
in the same way.
This method is given below.
Remember 
To ﬁnd the general solution of sin  x   "   k  or cos  x   "   k , you ﬁnd the two solutions 
in the interval 0°  *   #   *  360° and then add  n 360° to each of the solutions.

Note:   The following example illustrates how we use the general solution of an equation to 
ﬁnd all the solutions in a given interval.

Section 4.1  Revision of formulae   
In this section we will deal with some coordinate geometry formulae that you will have 
met in the course of your work for the Junior Certiﬁcate. The main formulae dealing with 
coordinates are given below:
1. Distance between two points 
The distance between A( x 1 ,  y 1 ) and B( x 2 ,  y 2 ) 
is  | AB |   !    √

2. The midpoint of a line segment

Section 4.2  The area of a triangle   
The area of the triangle with vertices (0, 0),  
( x 1 ,  y 1 ) and ( x 2 ,  y 2 ) is
Area  !    1   _

Note:  
If none of the vertices of the triangle is at the origin,  
we ﬁnd the image of the triangle under a translation  
so that one of the vertices is (0, 0).
Let  (2, 4)  →  (0, 0) 
(7, 3)  →  (5,  " 1)

Section 4.3  The equation of a line   
The equation of a line is generally given in the form  ax   $   by   $   c   "   0 , e.g., 2 x   #  3 y   "  12  !  0.
This may be described as the  general form of the equation of a line .
To ﬁnd the equation of a line, we generally need to know
 (i) a  point  on the line
 (ii) the  slope  of the line.
If ( x 1 ,  y 1 ) is a point on the line and  m  is the slope,  
we then use  y   #   y 1   "   m ( x   #   x 1 )  to ﬁnd the  
equation of the line.
The equation  y   "   mx   $   c
If the equation of a line is in the form
y   "   mx   $   c , then
 (i) the slope is  m
 (ii) the line intersects the  y -axis at (0,  c ).
c  is the value of  y  at the point where the line 
crosses the  y -axis and is called the  y  intercept.
The equation  y   "   mx   $   c  is generally referred to as the  slope-intercept  form of the equation of 
a line.
If the equation of a line is in the form 2 x   #  3 y   "  7  !  0, we express it in the form  y   !   mx   #   c .  
The slope is  m .
For example, if 
3 x   "  4 y   #  3  !  0, then
 
" 4 y   !   " 3 x   "  3
 
⇒  4 y   !  3 x   #  3  ⇒   y   !    3  
__   4  x   #    3  
__   4  ⇒   m   !    3  
__   4 
Collinear points lie on 
the same straight line.
The equation of a line with slope  m  
and containing the point ( x 1 ,  y 1 ) is 
y   #   y 1   "   m ( x   #   x 1 )
x

--- Page 153 ---

Note:  
 The slope of a line is deﬁned as the tangent of the angle which the line makes with 
the  positive  direction of the  x -axis.
 
1.   If the angle is less than 90°, the slope is positive.
 
2.   If the angle is between 90° and 180°, the slope is negative.
 
3.   tan 45°  !  1; tan 135°  !   " 1
More diﬃcult problems
To ﬁnd the equation of a line (or lines) we generally require two pieces of information. 
From the information given it may not be possible to ﬁnd a point on the line and the slope of the 
line immediately. When dealing with more difﬁcult problems, the following approaches should 
prove useful.
 1.  The equation of any line through the point (3, 4), for example, is  y   #   4   !   m ( x   #   3 ),
i.e.  mx   "   y   "  3 m   #  4  !  0.
A second condition should enable us to ﬁnd the value or values of  m .
 2.  The equation of any line parallel to  2 x   #   3 y   #  8  !  0 is   2 x   #   3 y   #   c   !  0.
The equation of any line perpendicular to 2 x   "  3 y   #  8  !  0 is 3 x   #  2 y   #   k   !  0.
The equation of any line parallel to  ax   #   by   #   c   !  0 is  ax   #   by   #   k   !  0.
The equation of any line perpendicular to  ax   #   by   #   c   !  0 is  bx   "   ay   #   k   !  0.

--- Page 154 ---

To ﬁnd where a line intersects the axes
To ﬁnd the point of intersection of a line and
 (i) the  x -axis, let  y   !  0 and ﬁnd the  x -value
 (ii) the  y -axis, let  x   !  0 and ﬁnd the  y -value.

--- Page 155 ---

Note:  
 To verify that a point is on a given line, we substitute the coordinates of  x  and  y  into 
the equation of the line. If the coordinates satisfy the equation, then the point is on 
the line.
 
For example, the point ( " 3, 2)  ∈   2 x   "  4 y   #  14  !  0, because
 
 
2( " 3)  "  4(2)  #  14  !   " 6  "   8  #  14

Section 4.4   Dividing a line segment in a given  
ratio

In the given diagram, the point C divides  
the line segment [PQ] in the ratio  a  :  b .

Section 4.5  Concurrencies of a triangle   
The line which joins a vertex of a triangle to  
 
the midpoint of the opposite side is called a  median .
In the given triangle [AM] is the median.

--- Page 159 ---

1. The Centroid
The given diagram shows the three medians 
[AE], [BF] and [CD] intersecting at the point G.
G is called the  centroid  of the triangle.
The medians of a triangle divide each other in the  
ratio 2 : 1.
In the given triangle, 
| AG |  :  | GE |   !  2 : 1;   | BG |  :  | GF |   !  2 : 1 and 
| CG |  :  | GD |   !  2 : 1.
If A( x 1 ,  y 1 ), B( x 2 ,  y 2 ) and C( x 3 ,  y 3 ) are the coordinates of the 
vertices of a triangle, then the coordinates of the centroid, G, are
 
G  !    ( "   x 1   #   x 2   #   x 3

 ,   y 1   #   y 2   #   y 3

  )  
2. The circumcentre
The circumcentre of a triangle is the point of intersection 
 
of the  mediators  (the perpendicular bisectors of 
the sides) of a triangle.
The line segment from a vertex of a triangle to the 
circumcentre is the radius of the circumcircle. 
This is shown here as  r .
3. The orthocentre
The orthocentre of a triangle is the point of intersection 
 
of the perpendiculars from the vertices to the  
opposite sides.
In the given triangle, H is the orthocentre.

Points in relation to a given line
The sign of the expression inside the modulus signs can be very useful when we are 
investigating whether points are on the same side or opposite sides of a given line.
1.  Perpendiculars to a line from points on the same side of the line have the same sign.
2.  Perpendiculars from points on opposite sides of a line have different signs.

we generally deﬁne the angle as shown on the right.

_________

More diﬃcult problems
A particular type of problem in coordinate geometry involves  
ﬁnding the equations of two lines through a given point and  
which make angles of 45°, for example, with a given line.
From the given diagram we can see that there are 2 lines through P  
which make angles of 45° with the line  l .
To ﬁnd the equations of the required lines, we start with the formula
tan  '   !   (    m 1   "   m 2  
_________  
1  #   m 1 m 2
 ,
where  '  is the angle between the line required and the given line and  
m 1  is the slope of the given line.
By solving the equation using the  (  signs, we get two values for  m 2 .

Section 4.8   Using linear relationships to solve  
problems   
In this section we will illustrate the importance of the straight line when the relationship 
between two variables is plotted on a graph. In many scientiﬁc experiments when the 
relationship between two sets of data is displayed graphically, the points often lie on, or very 
close to, a straight line. 

--- Page 168 ---

This line is generally referred to as the  line of best ﬁt .  
We will deal more fully with this line in another part of our course.
In this section we will deal only with straight-line graphs and show how useful they can be in 
the world of science and business.

Probability 1
Section 5.1  Permutations   
1. The fundamental principle of counting
The diagram below shows three towns  A ,  B  and  C . 
There are 2 roads from  A  to  B  and 3 roads from  B  to  C .
A
B
C

The number of ways a person can travel from  A  to  C  is 6. These are listed as follows:
(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5),(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5).
This illustrates that there are 2 ways of going from  A  to  B  and for  each  way of going from  A  
to  B , there are 3 ways of going from  B  to  C . 
Thus there are 3  !  2  "  6 ways of going from  A  to  C .
Similarly, if a car manufacturer produces 5 different models of a car and each model comes in 
4 different colours, then a customer has 5  !  4 i.e. 20  different ways in which he can select a car.
These examples illustrate what is generally referred to as the  Fundamental Principle of 
Counting  which can be stated as follows:
Fundamental   
If one task can be accomplished in  m  ways  and  following 
this a second task can be accomplished in  n  ways, 
then the ﬁrst task followed by the second task can be 
accomplished in  m   !   n  ways.

mutually exclusive   exhaustive events   Venn diagrams

--- Page 176 ---

Note:    The  Fundamental Principle of Counting  can be extended to any number of tasks.  
For example, if there are 3 roads from  A  to  B , 2 roads from  B  to  C  and 4 roads from  
C  to  D , then there are 
  3  !  2  !  4  i.e. 24 ways of going from  A  to  D .
2. Permutations
A permutation is an arrangement of a number of objects in a certain order.
If the letters  A ,  B  and  C  are written in a row, one after another, there are 6 possible 
arrangements as follows:
ABC ACB BAC BCA CAB CBA
Each arrangement is called a  permutation ; so there are 6 different permutations possible.
When calculating the number of permutations that can be made from a number of items, it 
is convenient to use “boxes”, and working from the left, write down the number of ways in 
which each box can be ﬁlled.
Again, returning to the permutations of the letters  A ,  B  and  C .  
The ﬁrst letter can be selected in 3 different ways.  
Once the ﬁrst place has been ﬁlled, there are only two letters left to choose from.  
Thus the second place can be ﬁlled in 2 ways.  
Similarly the third place can be ﬁlled in 1 way only.  
Thus the letters  A ,  B  and  C  can be arranged in
3  2  1   "  3  !  2  !  1  "  6 ways
3. Factorial notation
To represent 3  !  2  !  1, we write 3!, pronounced “three factorial”.
Similarly, 8  !  7  !  6  !  5  !  4  !  3  !  2  !  1  "  8!
In general, the product of all natural numbers from any number,  n , down to 1 is called  n  
factorial , and written as  n ! .
Deﬁnition   
n ! is the number of permutations of  n  different objects 
when all the objects are included in each arrangement.

--- Page 177 ---

Thus (i) 5 different objects can be arranged in 5!  i.e. 120 ways
 
(ii) 8 different objects can be arranged in 8!  i.e. 40320 ways.

--- Page 178 ---

4. Permutations of  n  diﬀerent objects taking  r  of them at a time  
To ﬁnd the number of ways the ﬁve letters  A ,  B ,  C ,  D ,  E  can be arranged in a line when 
taking 3 at a time, we could use boxes as follows:
5  4  3   "  5  !  4  !  3  "  60 ways.
The ﬁrst box can be ﬁlled in 5 ways, the second in 4 ways and the third in 3 ways.
Notice that  5  !  4  !  3  "    5  !  4  !  3  !  2  !  1

Section 5.2  Combinations   
A  combination  is a selection of objects chosen from a given set.  
When we select, for example, three letters from  A ,  B ,  C ,  D  and  E , then the combination  ABC  
is the same as the combination  BCA .  
Thus in combinations, unlike permutations, the order is not important.
We use the notation   ( !   7      3  )  to denote the number of ways in which three objects can be chosen 
from seven different objects.

Combinations from two diﬀerent sets  
If we have two different sets, one containing  m  different things and the other containing  n  
different things, the number of combinations which can be made containing  r  of the ﬁrst and  s  
of the second is,
  ( !   m  
      
r    )   !    ( !   n 
      s   )  
The selections of   ( !   m  
      
r    )   and   ( !   n 
      s   )   are  multiplied  because for each selection from   ( !   m  
      
r    )   we can 
associate every selection from   ( !   n  
      s   )   .

Section 5.3  Elementary probability   
Probability uses numbers to tell us how likely something is to happen.  
The  probability  or  chance  of something happening can be described by using words such as:
Impossible  Unlikely  Even Chance  Likely  Certain
An event which is  certain to happen  has a  probability of 1 .

--- Page 188 ---

An event which  cannot happen  has a  probability of 0 .
All other probabilities will be a number greater than 0 and less than 1.
The more likely an event is to happen, the closer the probability is to 1.
The line shown below is called a  probability scale .
Certain
Even Chance
Impossible
Likely

Before you start a certain game, you must throw a die and get a 6.  
The act of throwing a die is called a  trial .  
The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are all the possible  outcomes  of the trial.  
The required result is called an  event .
If you require an even number when throwing a die, then the  
 
event  or  successful outcomes  are the numbers 2, 4 and 6.
The chance of getting a red with this spinner is the same as the chance    
 
of getting a blue. Getting a red and getting a blue are  equally likely .
In general, if  E  represents an event, the probability  
of  E  occurring, denoted by  P ( E  ), is given below:
P ( E )  "    number of successful outcomes in  E  
 
 
________________________________  
 
 
number of possible outcomes  
 
Note:   1.   The probability of any event  E  cannot be less than 0 or greater than 1, i.e.,  
0  %   P ( E  )  %  1.
 
2.  The probability of a certainty is 1.
 
3.  The probability of an impossibility is 0.
 
4.   If  E  is an event, then the probability that  E  does not occur is 1 minus the 
probability that  E  occurs.  
This is written as   P ( E  not occurring)  !  1  "   P ( E  ) .
If  A  is an event, it will happen or not happen.
P ( A  happening)  "  1  #   P ( A  not happening).
P ( A )  "  1  #   P ( A & )
The result we want 
is called an  event .

{ HH ,  HT ,  TH ,  TT  }, where  H   "  head and  T   "  tail.
This set of possible outcomes is called a  sample space .
By using this sample space, we can write down the probability of getting 2 heads, for 
example.
P ( HH  )  "    1   _  
4   and  P (one head and one tail)  "    2   _  
4   "    1   _  
2  
In an experiment such as throwing two dice, for example, the construction of a sample space 
showing all the possible outcomes can assist in ﬁnding the probability of a given event.

Section 5.4   Experimental probability  
– Relative frequency   
In the previous section, we calculated probabilities on the basis that all outcomes are equally 
likely to happen. However in real-life situations, events are not always equally likely. For 
example, the probability of a football team winning a game, or the probability that the next 
car that passes the school gate will be coloured red, can only be estimated by analysing 
previous results or carrying out an experiment or survey.
Experiment  
John suspects that a coin is biased. In an experiment, he tossed the coin 200 times and 
recorded the number of heads after 10, 50, 100, 150 and 200 tosses.

--- Page 194 ---

The results are shown in the table on the right:
As the number of tosses increase, the number  
of heads divided by the number of tosses gets  
closer to 0.5, i.e.,   1   _  
2   .
This value is called  relative frequency  and  
it gives an  estimate of the probability  that  
the event will happen.
Thus an estimate of the probability that an event will occur, by carrying out a survey or 
experiment, is given by
Relative frequency  "    Number of successful trials  
 
 
________________________  
 
 
Total number of trials  
 
In general, as the number of trials or experiments increases, the value of the relative 
frequency gets closer to the true or theoretical probability.

Expected frequency  
A bag contains 3 red discs and 2 blue discs.         
A disc is chosen at random from the bag and replaced.
The probability of getting a blue disc is   2   _  
5   .
This means that, on average, you expect 2 blue discs  
in every 5 chosen or 20 blue discs in every 50 chosen.
To ﬁnd the expected number of blue discs when you choose a disc 100 times,
 (i) Work out the probability that the event happens once.
 (ii) Multiply this probability by the number of times the experiment is carried out.
Thus the expected number of blue discs is
  2   _  
5   !    100  
___  
1     "  40.             
Expected frequency is  
probability  !  number of trials.

Section 5.5   Mutually exclusive events  
– The addition rule   
Consider the following two events when drawing a card from a pack of 52 playing cards:
A  "  drawing an ace   B  "  drawing a king.
These two events are said to be  mutually exclusive  as they cannot occur together.
If the events A and B cannot happen together, then 
Events are mutually 
exclusive if they cannot 
happen at the same time.
P (A or B)  !   P (A)  $   P (B)
This is called the  addition law  for mutually exclusive events.
So  P (draw an ace  or  king)  "   P (ace)  $   P (king)
"    4  
__  
52   $    4  
__  
52  
"    8  
__  
52   "    2  
__  
13  
When events are not mutually exclusive  
We will now consider events which may occur at the same time.
If A is the event: selecting an ace from a pack of cards and 
 B is the event: selecting a heart from a pack of cards
 then  P (A)  "    4  
__  
52   and  P (B)  "    13  
__  
52  
In this situation, both events may occur at the same time since the  ace of hearts  is common to both.
In general, when two events A and B can occur at the same time,
P (A or B)  "   P (A)  $   P (B)  #   P (A and B)

--- Page 199 ---

Thus in the example given above, 
P (ace or heart)  "   P (ace)  $   P (heart)  #   P (ace and heart) 
A
Aces
Hearts
Ace

Hearts
H

__  
52   #    1  
__  
52  
"    16  
__  
52  
This result can be veriﬁed as there are 4 aces and 13 hearts in a pack of cards. Since one of 
the aces is the ace of hearts, there are 16 aces or hearts in the pack.
i.e.  P (ace or a heart)  "    16  
__  
52   , as already found.

Exhaustive events  
Consider these events when throwing a dice:
A: Getting an odd number
B: Getting an even number
These two events contain all the possible outcomes  
A set of events is exhaustive 
if the set contains all 
possible outcomes.
 
when a dice is thrown.
These events are said to be  exhaustive .
If A and B are exhaustive events, then
P (A)  $   P (B)  "  1.
Venn diagrams

Each region of a Venn diagram represents a different set of data.
The Venn diagram on the right shows two sets, A and B,  
A
S(30)

The number of elements in each region is also shown.

A
P (S) = 1
B
4––
15
3––
15
6––

2––

This is written as A / B.
12 is the number of elements in B but not in A.  
This is written as B /A.
 6 is the number of elements in A and B. This is written as A  %  B.
 4 is the number of elements in neither A nor B.
This is written as (A  &  B) & .
If information is presented in the form of a Venn diagram, it is easy to write down the 
probability of different events occurring.

--- Page 201 ---

In the diagram on the previous page, the probability of either A or B is given by  P (A  &  B).

His results are shown on the right.
The coin and the die do not affect each other,  
so their outcomes are  independent .
There are 12 equally likely outcomes of the coin  
and die, as shown in the diagram on the right.
From the sample space, we can see that the  
probability of a head and a 5 is   1  
__  
12   .
The probability of each outcome can also be found 
by multiplying the separate probabilities i.e.  P (H)  "    1   _  
2   ,  P (5)  "    1   _  
6   !   P (H and 5)  "    1   _  
2   !    1   _  
6   "    1  
__  
12  
This illustrates the  multiplication law  of probability which states that for independent events 
A and B,
   
P (A and B)  "   P ( A )  !   P (B)
   
This law is sometimes 
called the AND Rule.
The multiplication law applies to any number of independent events.
If the events are A, B, C, …, then
P (A and B and C …)  "   P (A)  !   P (B)  !   P (C)  !  …

--- Page 206 ---

The multiplication law is particularly useful when dealing with problems where one event is 
followed by another event such as throwing two dice or selecting two or more cards from a 
pack. The use of the multiplication law eliminates the need to construct a sample space and 
so signiﬁcantly reduces the work involved in solving certain problems.

Section 5.7  Conditional probability   
A box contains 2 red counters and 4 yellow counters,  
 
as shown.
One counter is picked at random.
P (red)  "    2   _  
6    and   P (yellow)  "    4   _  
6  
Suppose the counter is  not  put back in the box.
The contents of the box will be different, depending on whether the counter taken out was 
red or yellow.
If it was red, the box would now contain 1 red and    
 
4 yellow counters, as shown.
If another counter is now taken out at random, the probability that it is red is  dependent  on 
the colour of the ﬁrst counter.
This is called  conditional probability .
Returning to the second box above,  P (red) is now   1   _  
5   .
This probability is calculated on the assumption that a red was got on the ﬁrst draw.
The box and counters discussed above is an example of a situation where the probability of 
the second event depends on the outcome of the ﬁrst event.
If A and B are two events, the  conditional probability  that A occurs,  given that B has already 
occurred , is written  P (A | B).
P (A | B) is read as “the probability of A given B”.
The conditional probability (A | B) is illustrated in the  
A
A  !  B
B   
given Venn diagram.
To ﬁnd  P (A | B), the sample space is reduced to B only,  
since B has already occurred.
Thus  P (A | B)  "    #(A  %  B)  
_________  
#B  
  "    P (A  %  B)  
_________  
P (B)  
 .
The part of B in which A also occurs is the part denoted by A  %  B. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note:
This result can be described in words as follows: 
 
  “The probability of A given B is the probability of A and B divided by the probability of B”.
Thus  P (A | B)  "    #(A  %  B)  
_________  
#B  
  "    P (A  %  B)  
_________  
P (B)   
This result should be 
memorised as it will be 
used later in our study 
of probability.

A rule known as “ The General Multiplication Law ” which we will use in book 5.
The result  P (A | B)  "    P (A  %  B)  
_________  
P (B)  
 can be written as 
 
P (A  %  B)  "   P (A | B)  !   P (B) …  multiplying both sides by  P (B).
!   P (B  %  A)  "   P (B | A)  !   P (A)  "   P (A)  !   P (B | A)
!   P (A   '   B )  !   P (A)   (   P (B   |   A)  …  since  P (A  %  B)  "   P (B  %  A).

equal in measure.
Angles which meet at 
a point on a straight

A pair of angles 
that add together to

Theorem of Pythagoras
In a right-angled triangle, the area of the square drawn on the hypotenuse 
is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides.
Congruent triangles
Two triangles are  congruent  to one another if they are equal in all respects i.e. all corresponding 
sides are equal and all corresponding angles are equal.
It follows that congruent triangles have the same area.
(Note, congruent triangles ﬁt exactly on top of one another)
Triangles are congruent if one of these conditions is true:
Three pairs of sides are equal ( SSS ).
Two pairs of sides are equal and the angles between 
them (the included angle) are equal ( SAS ).
Two pairs of angles are equal and the  
sides between them are equal ( ASA ).
Both triangles have a right angle, the hypotenuses 
are equal and one pair of corresponding sides is 
equal ( RHS ).

Section 6.2   Theorems involving triangles and  
parallelograms   
Proofs of theorems
Geometry results or  theorems  are proved in a 
formal or structured way by using previously 
established results and axioms to explain the 
steps that we take. This method of proving 
geometric results was ﬁrst used by a Greek 
mathematician named Euclid about 300 BC. 
The proofs of numerous theorems are contained 
in his famous book on geometry called  Elements . 
Today, over 2000 years later, we still use Euclid’s 
approach to solve many problems in geometry.
In this section formal proofs of the theorems on 
your course are given. 
These theorems are numberd as in the ofﬁcial syllabus.
You may be asked to reproduce the proofs of theorems  11 ,  12  and  13  only.
A Corollary is a statement attached to a theorem which has been proven and follows 
obviously from it.
Note 1.  When we are asked to prove something in geometry it is important to give a reason 
for each deduction made. In a formal proof you must also provide the standard headings of 
“To prove”, “Given”, “Construction”, “Proof”
Note 2.  A  converse  is where we check if the proposition and conclusion are switched is the 
statement true.
e.g. In a right-angled triangle,  a 2   !   b 2   "   c 2  (where  a ,  b  and  c  are the lengths of the sides and  c  
is the longest side(hypotenuse).  
Converse :  If  a 2   !   b 2   "   c 2  (where  a ,  b  and  c  are the lengths of the sides and  c  is the longest side 
(hypotenuse) is the triangle a right-angled triangle? Answer: Yes (the converse is true).
e.g. If it is raining outside then the grass will be wet.
Converse :  If the grass is wet is it raining outside? Answer: Not necessarily.
An  axiom  is a statement 
accepted without proof. The 
angles in a straight line add to 
180° is an example of an axiom.
A  theorem  is a statement 
that can be shown to be true 
through the use of axioms and 
logical argument.

Angles and sides
The triangle ABC on the right is drawn to scale.
Notice (i) the largest angle is opposite the longest side
 
(ii) the smallest angle is opposite the shortest side.
These properties will hold for all triangles and are stated in  
the theorem below.
Theorem 7
The angle opposite the greater of two sides is greater than the angle opposite the lesser 
side.
 
In the triangle on the right, we are given the measures of 
the three angles.
The converse of the theorem above states that [BC] is the 
longest side because it is opposite the greatest angle and 
[AB] is the shortest side because it is opposite the smallest 
angle.
Converse of theorem 7
The side opposite the greater of two angles is longer than the side opposite the lesser angle.
Triangle inequality
The shortest distance between two points is the line that joins these points.
It follows from this that
| BA |   !   | AC |   #   | BC |
 Similarly 
| AB |   !   | BC |   #   | AC |
 
and 
| BC |   !   | CA |   #   | AB | .

Area of a triangle is

--- Page 231 ---

Since both triangles are identical, their areas are equal. 
The areas were found by using different bases  
and different perpendicular heights.
This illustrates an important theorem about the area of  
a triangle, as given on the right.
Area of a parallelogram
The ﬁgure on the right shows a parallelogram ABCD.
In a parallelogram, the opposite sides are parallel and  
equal in length.
The diagonal [DB] divides the parallelogram into two 
triangles, ABD and BCD.
These triangles are congruent because the three sides in  
! ABD are equal in length to the three sides in  ! BCD.
Since the triangles are congruent, they are equal in area.
This shows that the diagonal [DB] bisects the area of the parallelogram ABCD.
In the given parallelogram,

Problems involving area
The triangles ABC and ABD on the right are equal in  
area because they have the same base [AB] and  
they are between the same parallel lines.
The area of each triangle is   1   _  
2   | AB |   $   h .
Similarly, the parallelograms ABCD and  
ABEF are equal in area as they have the 
same base [AB] and they are between the 
same parallel lines.
Parallelograms (or triangles) with the 
same base and between the same parallel 
lines are equal in area.

1. Transversals
In the given diagram,  l ,  m  and  n  are parallel lines.
The lines  p  and  q  are called  transversals .
For the transversal  p ,  | AB |   "   | BC | .
In this case we say that the parallel lines cut off  
equal segments  on the transversal.
The line,  q , is another transversal. 
It can be shown that the line segments [DE] and [EF] are also equal in length.
The same property also holds for all other transversals.

If three parallel lines cut off equal segments on some transversal line, then they will cut off 
equal segments on any other transversal.

divided into three equal parts.
If lines are drawn through D and E parallel to BC, then the 
points X and Y will also divide the line [AC] into three equal 
parts.
In the given triangle, X divides the

3. Similar triangles
The triangles ABC and DEF shown below have  
equal angles.
Notice that the triangles have the same shape but  
different sizes. These triangles are said to be  
similar  or  equiangular  triangles.
The sides [AB] and [DE] are said  
to be  corresponding sides , as  
they are both opposite the 60° angle.
Notice that  | DE |   "  1  1   _

Section 6.4  Circle theorems   
In this section we will deal with the geometry of the circle and look at  
some important mathematical results known as  circle theorems .
Angles in circles
The diagram on the right shows the  ∠ AOB at the centre and the  
∠ ACB at the circumference of the circle, both standing on  
the arc AB.
An important circle theorem states that
Theorem 19
The angle subtended at the centre of a circle 
is twice the angle at the circumference.
ABCD is called the 
Golden Rectangle 
and is an important 
shape in architecture.

The theorem stated above gives rise to two important corollaries:
Corollary 2
Angles at the circumference on the same arc 
are equal in measure.
Corollary 3
Each angle in a semicircle is a right angle.
Corollary 4  (The  con erse  of Corollary 3)
If the angle on a chord [BD] at some point on a circle is 
a right angle, then [BD] is a diameter.

Tangents and chords
A tangent to a circle is a straight line that meets  
the circle at one point only.
In the given diagram,  !  is a tangent to the circle.
T is called the  point of contact .
[AB] and [CD] are  chords  of the circle.
In the given diagram, [OM] is perpendicular  
to the chord [AB].
| AM |   "   | MB | .
Theorem 21
The perpendicular from the centre of 
a circle to a chord bisects the chord.
The diagram shows a tangent PT to the circle  k  with centre O.
T is the point of contact and [OT] is a radius.

This diagram illustrates that the angle between a tangent and a  
radius is 90°. This result is stated in the theorem below:

Theorem 20
1.  A tangent is perpendicular to the radius that goes to the point of contact.
2.  If a point T lies on a circle  k  and a line TP is perpendicular to the radius to T, then TP 
is a tangent to  k .

If two circles intersect at one point only, then the two centres and the point of contact are 
collinear.

Introduction to calculus   
In this chapter, we begin the study of a very important branch of mathematics called  calculus . 
Differential calculus is mainly concerned with measuring the rate of change of one quantity 
with respect to another. For example, the speed of a car is the rate at which the distance it 
travels changes with respect to time. However, we know that a car is unlikely to travel at 
a constant speed, even for a short time. If a car is accelerating, it is changing speed by the 
second. If 60 km/hr is registered on the speedometer, this tells us the  instantaneous  speed.  
Calculus is the mathematical tool that will enable us to ﬁnd  instantaneous rates of change .
Section 7.1  Average rate of change   
We have already learned how to ﬁnd the slope of a line if

we are given two points on the line.
The slope,  m  !    y 2   "  y 1  
_______  
x 2   "  x 1  .
We will now refer to this slope as the  rate of change  of  
y  with respect to  x .
The slope of a line will always be a ﬁxed number as the  
slope is constant all along the line.

How do we ﬁnd the slope of a curve?
The slope of a curve at any point is deﬁned as  
the slope of the tangent to the curve at that point.

The diagram above also shows tangents drawn at three different points on the curve. 
The three tangents have different slopes –  m 1 ,  m 2  and  m 3 .
In the next section of this chapter, we will show how calculus can be used to ﬁnd the slope  
of the tangent to a curve at any point on the curve.

Lines are drawn through (1, 1) and (3, 9)  
and also through (1, 1) and (2, 4).
These lines are marked  l  and  m .

average rate of change .

Section 7.2  Limits – Continuity   
Introduction to limits  
Consider this sequence of numbers:   1   _  
2   ,   1   _  
4   ,   1   _  
8   ,   1  
__  
16   ,   1  
__  
32   ,   1  
__  
64   , …
If we add the ﬁrst two numbers, we get   3   _  
4   . If we add the ﬁrst three, we get   7   _  
8   .
If we add the ﬁrst six numbers, we get   63  
__  
64   .
Notice that the more terms we add, the closer the result gets to 1 but it  never reaches  1.  
In mathematics, we say that the  limit  of the sum of these numbers is 1.
We will now take the function  f  ( x )  !   x 2  and consider its value as  x   approaches  3 from below 
and above 3
1    f  (2)  !  4 ;  f  (2.5)  !  6.25 ;  f  (2.75)  !  7.5625 ;  f  (2.9)  !  8.41 …
2    f  (4)  !  16 ;  f  (3.5)  !  12.25 ;  f  (3.25)  !  10.5625 ;  f  (3.1)  !  9.61 …
As  x  gets closer to 3, the value of  x 2  gets closer to 9.
9 is said to be the limit of  f  ( x )  !   x 2  as  x   tends to  3.
This is written as   lim  
    
x → 3  ( x 2 )  !  9 .
We generally use the abbreviation  lim  for limit.
In general, to ﬁnd the limit of   f  ( x )  
    
x → a
   ,  we substitute 
a  for  x  in the function.
For example,  lim

Now consider  lim

When we substitute 3 for  x , we get   9  "  9

The result   0

its value cannot be determined.
If after substitution the result is   0

The most common method used involves factorising the numerator and denominator and 
then dividing by the common factor.

Limit of a function as  x   →   %   
In the example above, we investigated the limit of a function as the variable tended to a ﬁxed 
number. Now we will examine the limit of a function as the variable tends to inﬁnity.
We use the symbol  %  to denote inﬁnity.
Now consider  lim

When  x   !  10,   1

If the numerator is any ﬁxed number  k , the   lim

Since  lim

Continuity  
A function  f  ( x ) is said to be  continuous  when  x   !   a  if the graph of  y   !   f  ( x ) can be drawn 
through the point with coordinates  ( a ,  f  ( a ) )  without a break.
Otherwise, there is said to be a  discontinuity  at  x   !   a .
Most of the functions that we encounter on our course  
are continuous functions.

Notice that the curve approaches but never touches  
the line  x   !   " 1.
We say that the line  x   !   " 1 is an  asymptote  to the curve.
Similarly, the graph on the right above shows a break  
at  x   !  1.
Again, we say that the curve is not continuous at  x   !  1.
Asymptote  is a line that a

We could ﬁnd the slope of the tangent to the curve 
at the point (2, 4) by drawing an accurate curve and 
tangent and then measure the slope by ﬁnding a 
second point on the tangent. However, this method 
will give only an estimate, so some other method must 
be found.
The method used to ﬁnd the slope of a tangent

to a curve at any point is illustrated by the diagram  
on the right. If we select points  C  and  D  on the  
arc  AB , we notice that the closer the point moves  
towards  A , the closer the approximation to the slope  
of the tangent at  A .
As the point gets very close to  A , we say that
the slope of the tangent  !  the limit of the 
slope of the chord as the point approaches  A .

--- Page 271 ---

Diﬀerentiating from ﬁrst principles  
We will now consider the method of ﬁnding the slope of the tangent to the curve  y  !  f  ( x ) at 
any point A   ( x ,  f  ( x ) )  on the curve.
Let B   be another point on the curve such that

the  x -coordinate of B is  x  $  h , where  h   
represents a small increase.
Thus, the coordinates of B are
( x  $  h ,  f  ( x  $  h ) ) .
From the diagram, the slope of 
the chord AB   !    f  ( x  $  h )  "  f  ( x )

When  h  becomes very small, the slope of the tangent at A is the limit of the slope of  
the chord AB as  h  →   0.

We use the notation   d y  
___  
d x   (pronounced ‘dee  y  dee  x ’), or  f   # ( x )  (pronounced ‘ f  dash of  x ’) 
to represent the derived function or simply the  derivative .
The deri v ed function   
In general, for the curve  y  !  f  ( x ),
  d y

is called  differentiating from ﬁrst principles .
In the next section of this chapter, we will see that there are basic rules that can be used to 
reduce the work involved in differentiating from ﬁrst principles.
Note:  When a function is given in the form  f  ( x )  !  … , the derivative is written as  f  & ( x )  !  … .
When the function is given in the form  y  !   … , the derivative is written in 
the form   d y  
___  
d x   !  … .
For any function  y  !  f  ( x ),   d y  
___  
d x   may also be written as  d  
___  
d x   (  y ).
This is pronounced ‘the dee dee  x  of  y ’.

Section 7.4  Diﬀerentiation by rule   
In the previous section, we found the derivative of a function from ﬁrst principles.
This method becomes very tedious as the function becomes more complex.
We will now show how certain rules can be used to ﬁnd the derivative of a function without 
having to use the method of differentiation from ﬁrst principles.
It can be shown from ﬁrst principles that if
 (i)  y   !   x 2 , then   d y  
___  
d x   !   2 x
 (ii)  y   !  4 x 2 , then   d y  
___  
d x   !   8 x
 (iii)  y   !   x 3 , then   d y  
___  
d x   !   3 x 2
The pattern in these derivatives suggests a general result which is given below:
Differentiation by rule

If  y  !  x n , then   d y  
___  
d x   !  nx n " 1  for all  n  "   ! .
2. 
If  y  !  ax n , then   d y  
___  
d x   !  nax n " 1
In words, this rule may be expressed as follows:
To differentiate a term containing a power (index) of  x , multiply the coefﬁcient by the 
power (index) and reduce the power (index) by 1.

The derivative of a constant  
Notice that if  y  !  4 (a constant), then this can be written as  y  !  4 x 0 . 
… ( any number to the 
power of zero is 1)
Thus,  y  !  4 x 0   ⇒    d y  
___  
d x   !  (0)4 x " 1   !  0.
This shows that the derivative of a constant is zero.

The derivative of a sum or diﬀerence of two functions  
If a function  y  !   f  ( x ) consists of more than one term, we differentiate each term in  
turn to ﬁnd  f  & ( x ).

Section 7.5  Product, Quotient and Chain Rules   
1. The Product Rule
The function  y   !   (3 x  "  4)( x 2   $  2) can be differentiated by multiplying out the brackets 
and then differentiating the product.
Thus,  y   !   3 x 3 "  4 x 2   $  6 x  "  8
and 
  d y  
___  
d x   !   9 x 2   "  8 x  $  6.
When the expansion of brackets becomes too tedious, a product can be differentiated in 
a much shorter way by using a method generally called the  Product Rule .
Product Rule 
If  y  !  u v , where  u  and  v  are both functions of  x , then
  d y  
___  
d x   !   u   d v  
___  
d x   $   v    d u  
___  
d x  
Product Rule 
in words 
When a product consists of 2 factors, i.e.  y  !  (ﬁrst)(second), 
then the product rule may be memorised as follows:
“the ﬁrst  '  by the derivative of the second  $  the second  '   
 by the derivative of the ﬁrst”.
2. The Quotient Rule
When differentiating a function of the form  y   !    u  
__  
v   , where  u  and  v  are both functions of  x ,
for example  y  !    2 x  "  3  
______  
3 x  $  4  , we use the  Quotient Rule  given below:

--- Page 280 ---

Quotient Rule  
If  y  !    u

d x   "  u   d v  
___

___________

Quotient Rule 
in words
 
Given a quotient i.e.  y   !    top  
_______  
bottom   then the quotient rule can be 
expressed in words as:
  Bottom  '  Derivative of the top  "  Top  '  Derivative of the bottom  
 
 
 
 
 
__________________________________________________________  
 
 
 
(Bottom) 2  
 
3. The Chain Rule
When we write  y  !  (3 x  "  4) 3 , we say that  y  is a function of  x .
If we let   u  !  (3 x  "  4), then we have 
y  !   u 3  and  u  !  3 x  "  4.
Now,  y  is a function of  u  and  u  is a function of  x .
For this reason, the function  y   !   (3 x  "  4) 3  is said to be a  composite function  or a 
function of a function.
Other examples of composite functions are:
(i)  y   !   (1  "  6 x ) 4    (ii)  y  !    √
______  
5 x  $  2 
  (iii)  y  !   
3
  √
_______  
3 x 2   $  6 

--- Page 281 ---

The function  y   !   (3 x  "  4) 3  could be differentiated by expanding the brackets and 
differentiating the result. However, it can also be differentiated in a more economical 
way by using a method called the  Chain Rule.
To differentiate the function  y   !   (3 x  "  4) 3 , we let  u  !  3 x  "  4. 
Then,  y  !  u 3  and  u  !  3 x   "  4.
The Chain Rule states that   d y  
___  
d x   !   d y  
___  
d u   ·  d u  
___  
d x   .
  d y

!  3 u 2 .3 
⇒    d y  
___  
d u   !  3 u 2   and   d u  
___  
d x   !   3
 
!  9 u 2   !  9(3 x  "  4) 3
The Chain Rule  
If  y  is a function of  u , and  u  is a function of  x ,
  d y  
___  
d x   !   d y  
___  
d u   ·    d u  
___  
d x  

--- Page 282 ---

In the examples above,  u  was substituted for the function of  x  inside the brackets. 
In practice, we will omit this step and write down the derivative of a composite function 
without the use of substitution.

Section 7.6  Second derivatives   
For any function  y  !  f  ( x ), the ﬁrst derivative is   d y  
___  
d x   or  f  & ( x ).
If we differentiate the resulting function, we get the  second derivative .
The second derivative is denoted by   d 2 y  
___  
d x 2   or  f    ( ( x ) .
  d 2 y  
___  
d x 2  is pronounced ‘dee two  y  dee  x  squared’.
We learned earlier that for any function  y  !   f  ( x ),   d y  
___  
d x   represents the slope of the tangent 
to the curve at any point on the curve. When dealing with the graphs of functions in book 5,
we will see that   d 2 y  
___  
d x 2  gives the rate at which the slope is changing over a given interval.

The derivatives of the three principal trigonometric functions are highlighted below:

The following examples illustrate the use of the  Product Rule , the  Quotient Rule  and the 
Chain Rule  when differentiating trigonometric functions.
Use of Chain Rule  
The use of the Chain Rule is particularly important in the differentiation  
of trigonometric functions.
To differentiate  y  !  sin 4 x , we let  u   !   4 x .
 
y  !  sin  u 
⇒    d u  
___  
d x   !  4
⇒    d y  
___  
d x   !  cos  u
By the  Chain Rule ,   d y  
___  
d x   !   d y  
___  
d u   ·  d u  
___  
d x  
!  cos  u  '  4  !  4 cos  u   !   4 cos 4 x
In practice, we generally do not use the substitution method to apply the  Chain Rule .
If  y  !  sin 6 x  ⇒    d y  
___  
d x   !  cos 6 x .  d  
___

--- Page 288 ---

Here are two more examples of the use of the  Chain Rule :
 (i) If  y   !   sin  x 2  
(ii) If  y  !  cos(3 x 2   $  x )
 
    d y  
___  
d x   !  cos  x 2 .(2 x )

The derivative of sin n  x  and cos n  x   
To differentiate  y  !  sin 4   x , we let  u   !   sin  x .
⇒  
y  !   u 4  
⇒    d u  
___  
d x   !  cos  x
⇒    d y

Now,   d y

  d y  
___  
d x   !  4 sin 3   x .cos  x
Again, in practice we can write down the derivative of cos 3  x , for example, without using  
a substitution.
If  y  !  cos 3  x  
Similarly, if  y  !  tan(3 x 2 )
   d y  
___  
d x   !  3 cos 2   x .  d  
___  
d x   (cos  x ) 
 
  d y

!  3 cos 2   x .( " sin  x )  !   " 3 cos 2   x  sin  x 
 
 
!  6 x  sec 2 (3 x 2 )
Using the Chain Rule twice  
Consider the function  y  !  sin  3 (5 x  $  2).
⇒   y  !  [sin(5 x  $  2)] 3
Without using any substitution we can write down the derivative of sin 3 (5 x  $  2) by
 (i) ﬁnding the derivative of the power, i.e. 3 sin 2 (5 x  $  2)
 (ii) multiplying the result by the derivative of the trigonometric  function  sin(5 x   $   2), which 
is cos(5 x   $   2).
 (iii) multiplying the two previous results by the derivative of the angle (5 x $  2), i.e. 5.
Thus, for 
y  !  sin 3 (5 x   $   2)
 
  d y  
___  
d x   !  3 sin 2 (5 x  $  2) cos(5 x   $   2).5
 
  !  15 sin 2 (5 x  $  2) cos(5 x  $  2)
Similarly, if 
y  !  cos 4 (3 x  "  1)
 
  d y  
___  
d x   !  4 cos 3 (3 x  "  1)[ " sin(3 x  "  1).3]
 
  !   " 12 cos 3 (3 x  "  1) sin(3 x  "  1)
sin 3   x   !  (sin  x ) 3

Thus, it is important to note that sin " 1    1

To differentiate the function  y  !  sin " 1    x

sin  y  !    x

Section 7.9   Diﬀerentiation of exponential functions   
The word  exponent  is often used instead of  index .
A function such as  y  !  2 x , where the variable occurs in the index, is called  
an  exponential function .

three functions 
 (i)  y  !  2 x   (ii)  y  !   e  x   (iii)  y  !  4 x
The function illustrated by the red curve is  y   !   e  x . 
It is by far the most important exponential function.
It is generally referred to as  the  exponential function. 
e  is an irrational number whose value is 2.718,  
correct to three decimal places.
This function will be studied more closely in chapter 12.

--- Page 294 ---

The importance of the function  y  !  e  x  lies in the fact that  
the slope at any point on the curve is always the same as  
the  y -value of the function.
For example, if  x  !  2, then  y  !   e  2   !  7.39… 
If an accurate diagram is drawn, it can be shown that  
the slope of the tangent at the point  x  !  2 is also 7.39. 
This leads us to a very important derivative, namely:
For  y  !  e  x ,   d y  
___  
d x   !  e  x .
Notice that  e  x  is its own derivative and, in fact, is the only basic  
function which is its own derivative.

a body loses heat or radioactive decay.

Section 7.10   Diﬀerentiating logarithmic functions   
In the previous section we found the derivative 
of  exponential functions. A log function is the inverse 
function of an exponential function and will be studied 
in detail in chapter 12.
The equation 8  !  2 3  can be written as log 2 8  !  3, where 2 is  
the  base  number.
Logarithms to the base  e  are called natural logarithms.
i.e. if  y   !   e x  then  x   !  log e y  which is usually written  x   !  ln  y
or if  x   !   e y  then  y   !  ln  x .
For this reason,  y  !   ln  x  is the inverse of the function  y  !  e  x .
To ﬁnd the derivative of  y  !  ln  x , we use the fact that if  y  !  ln  x , then by deﬁnition  e  y   !  x .

When dealing with natural logarithms, the following results from chapter 12 are important:
    (i) log e  1  !  0

  (ii) log e   e   !  1 
… (log k k  !  1)
(iii) log e   e x   !   x  log e   e   !   x
The work involved in differentiating logarithmic functions can be simpliﬁed by using the

Section 8.1  Trigonometric identities   
We are already familiar with the three basic trigonometric ratios, namely sine, cosine and tangent.
Three related ratios are deﬁned as:
cosec  A   !    1  
_____  
sin  A   sec  A   !   1  
______  
cos  A   cot  A   !   1

__   x  !    y  
__   x  !  tan  "
⇒   tan   !   "    sin   !  
_____  
cos   !  
This relationship between trigonometric ratios is called an  identity  because it is true for  all 
values  of  "   in a given domain.
The  mandatory proofs  of key standard trigonometric formulae are boxed separately and are 
ﬂagged by a  Mandatory Proof  box. Other derivations are shown in the text and examples.

It follows from  5  that  sin 2   !   "   1  $  cos 2   !  and  cos 2   !   "   1  $  sin 2   ! .
The general method of proving an identity is to choose one side that allows development and 
show, by using known identities, that it can be simpliﬁed into the form of the other side.
This is illustrated in the following examples.

Identities involving the  Sine Rule  and  Cosine Rule
The  Sine Rule  states that   a  
_____  
sin  A   !    b  
_____

This can be also written as sin  A   !    a  sin  B

The  Cosine Rule  states that  a 2   !   b 2   %   c 2   &  2 bc  cos  A .
This can also be written as cos  A   !    b 2   %   c 2   &   a 2

Identities involving the sides  a ,  b  and  c  of a triangle generally require the use of the  Sine  or 
Cosine Rules  to prove them.

Section 8.2  Compound angles   
If  A  and  B  are two given angles, then ( A   %   B ) and ( A   &   B ) are called  compound angles .
In this section we will establish formulae for cos( A   '   B ), sin( A   '   B ) and tan( A   '   B ) by 
expressing them in terms of sin  A , cos  A  and tan  A .
We will ﬁrst establish the formula for cos( A   &   B ) and then use already established identities 
to prove the other formulae.

2.  the cosine rule.

But cos 2  A  %   sin 2  A  !   1 and cos 2  B  %   sin 2  B  ! 1

2.  Now using the cosine rule to ﬁnd  | PQ | , we have:
 | PQ | 2   !   | OP | 2   %   | OQ | 2   &  2 | OP |   | OQ |  cos( A   &   B )

  !  2  &  2 cos( A   &   B ) …  
Equating the two values for  | PQ | 2 , we have
 
2  &  2(cos  A  cos  B   %  sin  A  sin  B )  !  2  &  2 cos ( A   &   B )

the other formulae using the important identities shown  
on the right.
To prove that cos( A   #   B )   "   cos   A   cos   B   $   sin   A   sin   B
To derive the formula for cos( A   %   B ), we replace  B  with ( & B ) in formula  (i)  on the 
previous page:

By rearranging the formulae for cos 2 A , we can express cos 2   A  and sin 2   A  in terms of cos 2 A   
as follows:
 
cos 2 A   !  2 cos 2   A   &  1        or         
cos 2 A   !  1  &  2 sin 2   A
 
⇒  2 cos 2   A   !  1  %  cos 2 A  
⇒  2 sin 2   A   !  1  &  cos 2 A
 
⇒    cos 2   A   !    1   _  
2   (1  %  cos 2 A ) 
⇒    sin 2   A   !    1   _  
2   (1  &  cos 2 A )
cos 2   A   !    1   _  
2   (1  %  cos 2 A )     sin 2   A   !    1   _  
2   (1  &  cos 2 A )

The proofs of identities involving cos 2 A  often depend on selecting the appropriate formula 
for cos 2 A . The choice is generally between (2 cos 2   A   &  1) and (1  &  2 sin 2   A ).
If we are given 1  %  cos 2 A , then to eliminate the 1 we select (2 cos 2   A   &  1) for cos 2 A . 
Thus 1  %  cos 2 A  becomes 1  %  2 cos 2   A   &  1  !  2 cos 2   A .
Expressing sin 2 A , cos 2 A  and tan 2 A  in terms of tan  A
When proving identities it is often useful to express sin 2 A , cos 2 A  and tan 2 A  in terms of tan  A .
We have already proved that tan 2 A   !    2 tan  A

Section 8.4  Sum, diﬀerence and product formulae   
Page 15 of  Formulae and Tables  contains important formulae for changing sums or 
differences into products. These formula are given, without proof, below.

Note:  When changing a sum or a difference to a product, it is advisable to have the 
larger angle ﬁrst. 
Thus sin 3 x   %  sin 5 x  should be changed to sin 5 x   %  sin 3 x . 
Similarly, if we are given the product 2 sin 2 x  cos 3 x , we should change it to  
2 cos 3 x  sin 2 x .

We could also say that ‘ x  is the angle whose sine is   3   _

This is written as sin & 1    ( $   3   _

sin & 1  is pronounced ‘arc sin’.

Section 9.1  Sequences  
A  number sequence  is a set of numbers written down in a deﬁnite order.  
In most cases all the terms of the sequence are connected by a rule.
Examine the following sequences and state in words the rule that connects one term to  
the next. Hence ﬁnd the next two terms of each sequence.
 (i) 1,  3,  5,  7, … 
(vii) 1,  4,  9,  16, …
 (ii) 2,  5,  8,  11, …

The most basic number sequence is the set of natural numbers, N  "  {1, 2, 3, 4, …  n }; all other 
sequences can be compared to it.
Consider the natural numbers 
1, 2, 
3, 
4, 
5, …… 
n
and compare them with the sequence  →  1, 3, 
5, 
7, 
9, …… 2 n   !  1
 
T 1 ,  T 2 ,  T 3 ,  T 4 ,  T 5 , …… 
T n
The ﬁrst term is  T 1   ;   the second term is  T 2 .
T n   is called the  n th term and it gives us the rule needed to ﬁnd any term of the sequence.
T n   "   2 n   !  1
Let  n   "  1,   T 1   "  2(1)  !  1  "  1
Let  n   "  2,   T 2   "  2(2)  !  1  "  3
Let  n   "  3,   T 3   "  2(3)  !  1  "  5
Let  n   "  4,   T 4   "  2(4)  !  1  "  7 etc.
Sequences are often derived from patterns created by different processes. In biology the 
arrangement of leaves on a stem can be described by the ‘Fibonacci sequence’ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …
Hence the rule  T n   "   2 n   !  1 produces 
the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, …

Section 9.2  Arithmetic sequences  
A sequence in which each term changes by the same ﬁxed amount is called an  arithmetic sequence .
For example, 
3,    7,      11,   15, . . . . . each term increases by 4.
3,    1,     ! 1,  ! 3, . . . . . each term decreases by 2.
If we let the ﬁrst term be  a  ( "   T 1 ), and the difference between consecutive terms be  d  (called 
the common difference), then every arithmetic sequence can be represented by
 
T 1 , 
T 2 , 
T 3 , 
T 4  
. . . . . 
T n
 
a, 
a  #  d a  #   2 d, a  #   3 d, 
. . . . .  a  #   ( n  !   1) d
For the sequence:  3, 7, 11, 15, …
a   "  3 
T n   "   a  #   ( n  !   1) d
d   "  7  !  3  "  4 
  "  3   #   ( n  !   1)4

T n   "  4 n  !   1.

In every arithmetic sequence,

T n   "   a  #   ( n  !   1) d

The sequence 3, 1,  ! 1,  ! 3, . . . . has an inﬁnite number of terms.
The sequence 3, 1,  ! 1,  ! 3, . . . .  ! 35 has a ﬁnite number of terms.
If we are given  T n   "   ! 35, we can ﬁnd the number of terms ( n ) in the sequence if we  
know the formula for  T n .

--- Page 331 ---

>  Given an arithmetic sequence  T 1 ,  T 2 ,  T 3 ,  T 4 ,  T 5 , ……  T n   ,
T 3   !   T 2   "   T 4   !   T 3   "   T 5   !   T 4   "  the common difference ( d ).
In general terms:
T n   #  1   !   T n "   d  (the common difference).
A corollary to this is as follows:
To prove that a sequence is arithmetic, we must show that  T n  #   1   !   T n  is a constant.
>  Also, if  T n  #   1   !   T n   $  0, then the sequence is increasing
 
if  T n  #   1   !   T n   %  0, then the sequence is decreasing.
Note, to ﬁnd  T n  #   1 , substitute ( n   #  1) for  n  in  T n  .
 
If  T n   "  3 n   #  1,
 
 T n  #   1   "  3( n   #  1)  #  1  "  3 n   #  4.

Section 9.3  Arithmetic series  
When the terms of a sequence are added, a  series  is formed.
T 1 ,  T 2 ,  T 3 ,  T 4 , …  T n  is a sequence  ; e.g. 3, 6, 9, 12, …
T 1   #   T 2   #   T 3   #   T 4 , …  #   T n  is a series  ; e.g. 3  #  6  #  9  #  12  #  …
We use  S n  to represent the sum of  n  terms of a series,
i.e.  S n   "  T 1   #   T 2   #  T 3   #  T 4   #  …  T n
To ﬁnd an expression for  S n , we note that in an arithmetic sequence,
 
T n   "   a   #  ( n   !  1) d 
(where  a   "   T 1 , the ﬁrst term, and  d   "  the common difference)
⇒  
T n   !   1   "   a   #  [( n   !  1)  !  1] d
 
  "   a   #  ( n   !  2) d
 
T 3   "   a   #  2 d

Also,

Sigma ( Σ ) notation

Section 9.4  Geometric sequences  
A  geometric sequence  is formed when each term of the sequence is obtained by multiplying 
the previous term by a ﬁxed amount.
For example, 
2,    6,      18,   54, . . . . . each term increasing by a factor of 3.
4,    2,    1,      1   _  
2   , . . . . .  
each term decreasing by a factor of   1   _  
2   .  
For any geometric sequence, the ﬁrst term is denoted by  a  and the ratio between consecutive 
terms is  r  (called the common ratio); then every geometric sequence can be represented by
 
T 1  , 
T 2  , 
T 3  , 
T 4  , 
T 5  , 
. . . . . 
T n   
 
a , 
ar , 
ar   2 , 
ar   3 , 
ar   4 ,

ar  n   !   1  
Consider the sequence:

>  Given three consecutive terms of a geometric sequence,  T 1 ,  T 2 ,  T 3 , we note that
  T 2

>  We also note that   a  
__   r   ,  a ,  ar  are three consecutive terms of a geometric sequence, with ﬁrst
 
term   a

Multiplying these terms gives    a  
__   r    &   a   &   ar   "   a 3 , i.e. the cube of the middle term.
For example: 2, 6, 18 are in geometric sequence,
 
⇒  2  &   6  &   18  "  216  "  6 3
Also, 1,    1   _

Note:   When solving an equation such as 4 n   !  1   "  4096, we can use two different methods.
Method A :  Express 4096 as a power of  
  
 
4 using a calculator and  
trial and error.

Exponential  sequences  
Exponential functions of the form  y   "  A a x , where A  
is the initial value and  a  the multiplier or  
common ratio, produce geometric sequences.
Consider a ball dropping from a  
height of 10 m.
If the ball bounces back to   2   _  
3   of its original  
height on each bounce, the height of the  
ball is given by the following pattern:
After 1 bounce: 
10  &    2   _  
3   "  10  ( %   2   _  
3   )

After 2 bounces: 10  &    2   _

After 3 bounces: 10  &    2   _

After  n  bounces: 10  &    ( %   2   _

Method B : Using logs (see chapter 12)

Section 9.5  Limits of sequences  
As the number of terms in the sequence becomes very large, in some cases the terms of the 
sequence converge to a ﬁxed value which we call the  limit  of the sequence.
If such a limit exists, the sequence is said to be convergent.
A sequence which does converge is said to be divergent.
The sequence 0.3, 0.33, 0.333, 0.3333,... converges to 1/3.
To show that a sequence is 
geometric, we must show

Note:  Although the n th  term ( T n ) never becomes zero,  
by taking  n  large enough we can make the difference  
between  T n  and zero so small, it is negligible.
In chapter 7 we have already stated that

In practice (as in Ch 7) to evaluate the limit of a fraction, divide both numerator and 
denominator by the highest power of  n  in the expression, and then use the appropriate rule 
above. Remember:  lim

Section 9.6  Geometric series  
When the terms of a geometric sequence are added, a geometric series is created.
For example, 2  #  6  #  18  #  54  #  ... is a geometric series.
To ﬁnd the sum of a series,  a 1   #   a 2   #   a 3   #   a 4   #  ... we consider a sequence of partial sums
where  S 1   "   a 1 ,  S 2   "   a 1   #   a 2 ,  S 3   "   a 1   #   a 2   #   a 3  and  S n   "   a 1   #   a 2  +  a 3   #  ....  a n .

--- Page 349 ---

To ﬁnd a formula for  S n , we use the following procedure:
 
S n   "   a   #   ar   #   ar   2   #  . . . . .  ar  n   !  3   #   ar  n   !  2   #   ar  n   !  1
 
⇒   r . S n   "  
ar   #   ar   2   #  . . . . .  ar  n   !  3   #   ar  n   !  2   #   ar  n   !  1   #   ar n 
Subtracting: 
S n   !   rS n   "  
a   !   ar  n
 
!   S n (1  !   r )  "   a (1  !   r  n )
 
!   S n   "    a (1  !   r  n )  
_________

The sum to  n  terms of a geometric sequence,
S n   "    a (1  !   r  n )  
_________  
1  !   r     , where  a  is the ﬁrst term and  r  is the common ratio.
…  multiplying 
each term by  r

--- Page 350 ---

It is very important to understand the effect the value of  r  has on the sum of a geometric 
series. Consider three geometric sequences –  A ,  B  and  C  – where  A  has a common ratio of  
r   "  2,  B  has a common ratio of  r   "  1, and  C  has a common ratio of  r   "    1   _  
2   .
Starting with a ﬁrst term value of 1, we get:

If | r |  $  1, the values of  T n  and  S n   , as   
n  gets bigger, increase very rapidly.
If | r |  "  1, then the sequence 
behaves like an arithmetic 
sequence with a constant  
amount added each term.
If | r |  %  1, then the value of  S n  is  
said to have a ‘‘limiting value’’.
In series  C  above, the sum  S n  
approaches the value 2.
By taking a sufﬁciently large value 
of  n , we can make  S n  as near to 2  
as we wish, that is, we can make  
2  !   S n  as small as we wish.
We say that  S n  approaches  
a limiting value of 2  as  n  approaches inﬁnity.
This is written as:  S n   →  2 as  n   → ∞  or  lim  
    
n   → ∞   S n   "  2.
In words, we say that ‘‘the limit of the partial sum  S n , as  n  tends to inﬁnity, is 2.”
Now consider the formula for the sum to  n  terms of a geometric series if | r |  %  1.
S n   "    a (1  !   r   n )

1  !   r    
When | r |  %  1,  r   n  will approximate to zero for large values of  n , i.e.  r   n   →  0 as  n   →   ∞ .
Thus,  S n   "    a (1  !   r   n )

Section 9.7  Other sequences   
In some cases  terms of a sequence might be deﬁned as a function of preceding terms:
 (i)  T n   #  1   "  2 T n   #  2 where  T 1   "  2
 (ii)  T n   #  2   "   T n   #  1   !   T n  where  T 1   "  3 and  T 2   "  1
In each case a relationship between terms is given and a starting value  T 1  (or  T 1  and  T 2 )
These are referred to as  recurrence relations .

Section 9.8  Number patterns – Revisited  
Linear, Quadratic and Cubic patterns
In our study of algebra, we discovered that we can identify patterns in certain number 
sequences by calculating differences.
The sequence  ! 4, 0, 4, 8, 12, . . . . has a ﬁrst  
Sequence

difference of  # 4 creating a formula for  
T n   "  4 n   #   a , where  n   "  1, 2, 3, . . . . etc. 
Therefore, if  n   "  1, then  T 1   "  4(1)  #   a   "   ! 4 
 
⇒   a   "   ! 8 
!  A constant ﬁrst difference gives rise to an arithmetic ( linear ) pattern,  T n   "  4 n   !  8.
As the following table indicates, the sequence

A constant second difference indicates a  quadratic  ( n 2 ) pattern,  an 2   #   bn   #   c .
Consider  T n   "   an 2   #   bn   #   c  for all values of  n   '  1.  
The following table evaluates the ﬁrst and second differences in terms of  a ,  b  and  c .

From this table we can see that the second difference of a quadratic pattern of numbers is 
always 2 a , twice the coefﬁcient of  n 2 .
!  if the second difference is  # 4  ⇒  2 a   "  4 
 
a   "  2
!   T n   "  2 n 2   #     bn   #   c  for  n   "  1, 2, 3, etc.
To ﬁnd  b  and  c , we use simultaneous equations as follows.
T n   "  2 n 2   #   bn   #   c  for  n   "  1, 2, 3, etc.
Let  n   "  1,  T 1   "  2(1) 2   #   b (1)  #   c   "  7
 
⇒   b   #   c   "  5
Let  n   "  2,  T 2   "  2(2) 2   #   b (2)  #   c   "  17
 
⇒  2 b   #   c   "  9
 
b   #   c   "  5
 
!   b   "  4
If  b   "  4, then 4  #   c   "  5,
 
⇒   c   "  1
!   T n   "  2 n 2   #  4 n   #  1 for  n   "  1, 2, 3, etc.

The method of ﬁnite differences can be used to study patterns of numbers with higher powers.
If the third difference is constant we have a  cubic pattern  ,  T n   "   an 3  #   bn 2 #   cn   #   d  etc.

In summary, when a process is examined and a number pattern identiﬁed, we can create a 
formula for successive elements under such headings as (i) Arithmetic (Linear) (ii) Quadratic 
(iii) Cubic (iv) Geometric (Exponential) by identifying the link between elements of the pattern.

Introduction to statistics   
The aim of statistics is to help us make sense of large amounts of information or data.  
In pursuit of this aim, statistics divides the study of data into three parts:
 (i) Collecting data
 (ii) Describing and presenting data
 (iii) Drawing conclusions from data.
In this chapter, we will discuss the variety of ways that information or data can be collected. 
These include questionnaires, experiments and observations. Once data has been gathered, 
we must then concern ourselves with the  description  of data so that ordinary people can 
understand it. We can do this by representing the data graphically. You will meet a variety of 
graphical methods in this chapter, as shown below. These are known as  descriptive statistics .
Ke words
discrete data   continuous data   categorical data   primary data 
secondary data   univariate   bivariate   surveys   questionnaires 
control group   population   sample   stratiﬁed   systematic   quota

interquartile range   standard deviation   percentile   stem and leaf diagram 
histogram   positive skew   negative skew   explanatory variable    
response variable   random sample
Statistics 1

--- Page 365 ---

Another way of making a large amount of data easily understood is by  summarising  the data. 
Data may be summarised by simply ﬁnding an average or some other number that could be 
representative of the data as a whole. These numbers are known as  summary statistics .
One of the most widely-used and important statistical processes is concerned with gathering 
information from a small group of people (or items) and using this data to draw conclusions 
about a much larger group of people. A good example of this is provided by the opinion 
poll. A poll is taken of a few thousand people. From the information that these people 
provide, remarkably accurate conclusions can be drawn that refer to the whole population, 
which is many times greater in number. Collecting information from a small group to draw 
conclusions about a large group is know as  inferential statistics .
Section 10.1  Types of data   
When we observe, count or measure something, we end up with a collection of numbers. These 
numbers are called  data . Data is the plural of  datum  which means a piece of information.
1. Numerical data
Data which can be counted or measured is called  numerical  data because the answer is a 
number. Numerical data can be either  discrete  or  continuous .
Discrete data
Data which can take only certain 
individual values is called  discrete data .
Here are some examples of  discrete  
data :
>  The number of goals scored by 
football teams on a Saturday
>  The number of desks in the classrooms 
of the school
>  The marks achieved in a test
Continuous data
Continuous data is measured on some 
scale and can take any value on that scale.
Here are some examples of  continuous 
data :
>  The heights of students in your class
>  The speed of cars passing a certain 
point on a road
>  The time taken to complete a 
100-metre sprint

--- Page 366 ---

2. Categorical data
The answer to the question, ‘What colour is your car?’ will not be a numerical value.
Rather, it will ﬁt into a group or category such as blue, red, black, white, …
Data which ﬁts into a group or category is called  categorical data .
Here are some examples of categorical data:
>  gender (male, female)
>  country of birth (Ireland, France, Spain, Nigeria …)
>  favourite sport (soccer, hurling, tennis, basketball …)
The three examples of data above are generally referred to as  nominal categorical data .
Categorical data in which the categories have an obvious order such as ﬁrst division, second 
division, third division, etc, is called  ordinal data .
Other examples of ordinal data are:
>  type of house (1-bedroomed, 2-bedroomed, 3-bedroomed)
>  attendance at football matches (never, sometimes, very often)
>  opinion scales (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree).
The data you collect can be divided into two broad categories, namely,  primary data  and 
secondary data .
3. Primary data
Data that is collected by an organisation or an individual who is going to use it is called 
primary data .
Primary data is generally obtained
>  by using a questionnaire
>  by carrying out an expeirment
>  by investigations
>  by making observations and recording the results.
4. Secondary data
Data which is already available, or has been collected by  
somebody else for a different purpose, is called secondary data.
Secondary data is obtained
>  from the internet, e.g., the National Census
>  from published statistics and databases
>  from tables and charts in newspapers and magazines.
5. Univariate data
When one item of information is collected, for example, from each member of a group of 
people, the data collected is called univariate data.

--- Page 367 ---

Examples of univariate data include:
>  colour of eyes
>  distance from school
>  height in centimetres.
6. Bivariate data
Data that contains  two items  of information, such as the height and weight of a person, is 
generally called  paired data  or  bivariate data .
Examples of bivariate data are:
>  hours of study per week and marks scored in an examination
>  the age of a car and the price of that car
>  the engine sizes of cars and the number of kilometres travelled on a litre of petrol.
Colour of hair and gender is an example of  bivariate categorical data .
The number of rooms in a house and the number of children in the house is an example of 
bivariate discrete data .

Section 10.2  Collecting data   
Data is collected for a variety of reasons and from a variety of sources.
Companies do market research to ﬁnd out what customers like or dislike about their products 
and to see whether or not they would like new products. The government carries out a  census  
of every person in the country every ﬁve years. Local government, education authorities and 
other organisations use the information obtained for further planning.
Data can be collected through direct observation such as a naturalist observing animal 
behaviour. In an observational study, the observer wishes to record data without interfering 
with the process being observed.
Apart from observational studies, data may also be collected by 
>  carrying out a survey
>  doing an experiment
>  conducting interviews or completing questionnaires
>  using a data logger which records data or readings over a period of time, using a sensor.

--- Page 370 ---

1. Surveys
Surveys are particularly useful for collecting data that is likely to be personal.
The main survey methods are:
>  postal surveys in which people are asked questions
>  personal interviews in which people are asked questions; this type of survey is very  
widely-used in market research
>  telephone surveys; here the interview is conducted by phone
>   observation , which involves monitoring behaviour or information.
Survey method
Advantages
Disadvantages
Observation
>  Systematic and mechanical
>  Results are prone to chance
Personal interview and 
telephone survey
>  Many questions can be asked 
>  High response rate
>  Expensive 
>   Interviewer may inﬂuence 
responses
Postal survey
>  Relatively cheap 
>   Large amounts of data can 
be collected
>   Limited in the type of data 
that can be collected 
>  Poor response rate
2. Questionnaires
One of the most commonly-used methods of conducting a survey is by means of a 
questionnaire.
A  questionnaire  is a set of questions designed to obtain data from individuals.
People who answer questionnaires are called  respondents .
There are two ways in which the questions can be asked.
>  An interviewer asks the questions and ﬁlls in the questionnaire.
>  People are given a questionnaire and asked to ﬁll in the responses themselves.
When you are writing questions for a questionnaire,
>  be clear on what you want to ﬁnd out and what data you need
>  ask short, concise questions
>  start with simple questions to encourage the person who is giving the responses
>  provide response boxes where possible:    Yes 
    No 
>  avoid leading questions such as
 
‘Don’t you agree that there is too much sport on television?’
or 
‘Do you think that professional footballers are overpaid?’
>  avoid personal questions such as, 
 
‘Do you live in an afﬂuent area?’ 
or 
‘Are you well educated?’ 
or 
‘Are you overweight?’
A choice of responses can be very useful in replying to the question, ‘What age are you?’
Here is an example: 
Tick your age in one of the boxes below:
 
 
 
 
 
Under 18 years 
18–30 
31–50 
Over 50

--- Page 371 ---

Notice that there are no gaps in the ages and that only one response applies to each person.
When you are collecting data, you need to make sure that your survey or experiment is  fair  
and avoids  bias . If bias exists, the data collected might be unrepresentative.
The boxes given below contain questions that should be avoided because they either are too 
vague , too  personal , or may  inﬂuence  the answer.
How often do you play tennis?
Sometimes 
  Occasionally 
  Often 
  The three words  sometimes ,  
occasionally  and  often  mean 
different things to different people.
Normal people enjoy swimming. 
Do you enjoy swimming?
Yes 
    No 
  This is a leading question and may cause the result 
to be biased. 
The ﬁrst sentence should not be there.
Have you ever stolen goods from a supermarket?
Yes 
    No 
 
 Few people are likely to answer 
this question honestly if they have 
already stolen.
Whenever you undertake a survey or experiment, it is advisable to do a pilot survey. A pilot 
survey is one that is carried out on a very small scale to make sure the design and methods 
of the survey are likely to produce the information required. It should identify any problems 
with the wording of the questions and likely responses.
3. Designed experiments
In statistics, the word ‘experiment’ generally refers to a situation where the experimentor 
carries out some activity and records the results by counting or measuring or simply 
observing.
Thus an experiment may consist of
>  tossing three coins and recording the number of times two heads show
>  measuring the circumference of oak trees in a wood
>  throwing a dice several times to determine if it is biased
>  recording the side-effects of a new drug

4. Control group
If we wish to investigate whether a new drug has any effect on those who take it, we select a 
group of patients, chosen at random, to form a sample. The sample is then divided randomly 
into two groups. Both groups think that they are taking the new drug, but only the ﬁrst group 
actually take it.
The second group are given an inactive substance (or placebo) but they think they have taken 
the drug. This second group is called a  control group . If more patients get better in the ﬁrst 
group, then the drug has an effect.

Explanatory and response variables  
In a statistical experiment, one of the variables will be controlled while its effect on the other 
variable is observed.
The controlled variable is called the  explanatory variable .
The effect being observed is called the  response variable .

Section 10.3  Populations and sampling   
In a statistical enquiry, you often need information about a particular group. This group is 
known as the population and it could be small, large or even inﬁnite.
Examples of populations include
 (i) all second-level pupils in Ireland
 (ii) paid-up members of golf clubs
 (iii) people entitled to vote in a general election.
If information is obtained from all members of a population, the survey is called a census.
Sample survey  
When a population is large, taking a census can be very time-consuming and difﬁcult to do 
with accuracy. So when a census is ruled out as being impractical, information is normally 
taken from a small part of the population. The chosen members of the population are called 
a  sample  and an investigation using a sample is called a  sample survey . Data from a sample 
can be obtained relatively cheaply and quickly. If the data is representative of the population, 
a sample survey can give an accurate indication of the population characteristic that is being 
studied.
The  size  of a sample is important. If the sample is too small, the results may not be very 
reliable.
If the sample is too large, the data may take a long time to collect and analyse.
However, large samples are more likely to give reliable information than small ones.
Bias in sampling  
The sample you select for your study is very important. If the sample is not properly selected, 
the results may be  biased . If  bias  exists, the results will be distorted and so may not be 
representative of the population as a whole.

--- Page 375 ---

Bias in a sample may arise from any of the following:
>   Choosing a sample which is not representative
Example  
Cara is doing a survey on people’s attitude towards gambling. If she stands 
outside a casino and questions people as they enter or leave, the results will 
be biased as these people are already involved in gambling.
>   Not identifying the correct population
Example  
The school principal wants to ﬁnd out about students’ attitudes to school 
uniforms. She questions ten Leaving Certiﬁcate students only. This may lead 
to biased results as the opinions of the younger students (from 1st year to 5th 
year) are not included.
>   Failure to respond to a survey
Many people do not ﬁll in responses to questionnaires sent through the post. Those who 
do respond may not be representative of the population being surveyed.
>   Dishonest answers to questions
Sampling methods  
The purpose of sampling is to gain information about the whole population by selecting a 
sample from that population. If you want the sample to be representative of the population, 
you must give every member of the population an equal chance of being included in the 
sample. This is known as  random sampling . Before a random sample is selected, a  sampling 
frame  must be used to identify the population. A sampling frame consists of all the items in 
the population to ensure that every item has a chance of being selected in the sample.
Some of the most commonly-used sampling methods are given below.
1. Simple random sampling
A sample of size  n  is called a  simple random sample  if every possible sample of size  n  has an 
equal chance of being selected. In practice, this means that each member of the population 
has an equal chance of being selected.
There are many ways of doing this.
Methods for choosing a  simple random sample  could involve giving each member of the 
population a number and then selecting the numbers for the sample in one of these ways:
>  putting the numbers into a hat and then selecting however many you need for the sample
>  using a random number table
>  using a random number generator on your calculator or computer
Any of these methods are suitable only if the population is relatively small and the sampling 
frame is clearly identiﬁed.
2. Stratiﬁed sampling
Most populations contain identiﬁable strata. For example 
male / female or Retired / working / in education etc.
<40 yrs
40–60 yrs
>60 yrs
45%
40%
15%

--- Page 376 ---

Assume this table reﬂected the age distribution of a particular county. If samples are being used to 
determine preferences in music or ﬁlm or technological innovation in this county and if the sample 
(randomly selected)  contain proportions (of age) which do not reﬂect their proportion in the 
population then there will obviously be an inbuilt bias and a misleading view of the population.
Stratiﬁed sampling  is used when the population can be split into separate groups or strata that 
are quite different from each other. The number selected from each group is proportional to 
the size of the group. Separate random samples are then taken from each group.
3. Systematic sampling
A sample which is obtained by choosing items at regular intervals from an unordered list is 
called a  systematic sample . For example, if you wish to choose 20 students from 200 students, 
you could take every tenth student from the register. Select a random number between 1 and 
10, e.g., 4. Thus you could select the 4th, 14th, 24th, 34th … until you get 20 students
4. Quota sampling
Quota sampling  is widely used in market research and in opinion polls. First the population is 
divided into groups in terms of age, general education levels, social class, etc. The interviewer 
is then told how many people (the quota) to interview in each of these groups, but the 
interviewer makes the choice of who exactly is asked. A disadvantage of quota sampling is 
that the actual people or items chosen are left to the discretion of the interviewer which could 
lead to bias. An advantage of quota sampling is that no sampling frame is required.
5. Cluster sampling
If the population is geographically widely spread, simple random sampling would be very 
difﬁcult and very expensive. In this case the population is divided into clusters (regions). The 
smaller the cluster the better. 
A possible procedure is then:
 (i) Select a cluster (region) at random
 (ii)  Select every member of the cluster or a random sample of members in each Cluster. 
Opinion polls generally use cluster sampling.   

--- Page 377 ---

6. Convenience sampling
Convenience sampling  involves selecting a group of people because it is easy for us to contact 
them and they are willing to answer our questions. For example, a sample of 40 students 
in a school could be selected by simply taking the ﬁrst 40 names on the school register. 
Convenience sampling is very quick and easy to organise but it can lead to high levels of bias 
and so is very likely to be unrepresentative.

Section 10.4  Measures of location   
When we are presented with a huge mass of numbers (data), we need just one or two 
numbers that would convey most of the essential information. These numbers are generally 
referred to as  summary statistics .
There are two main types of summary statistic, namely,  measures of location  and  measures 
of spread . Measures of location answer the question ‘What value is typical of the values in 
the data?’ Measures of spread answer the questions ‘How much do the values vary?’ or ‘How 
spread out are the values?’
In this section, we will deal with measures of location or averages.
There are three different types of average in statistics.
These are the  mode , the  mean  and the  median .
1. The Mode
The  mode  is the most common value in a set of data. The mode is very useful when one value 
appears much more often than any other. It is easy to ﬁnd and can be used for non-numerical 
data such as the colours of cars sold by a car dealership.

--- Page 380 ---

The following numbers represent the ages of students on a school bus.
10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 15, 15, 16, 16, 16, 17, 17
The number in this list with the greatest frequency is 15.
!   the mode  !  15 years.
2. The Mean
To ﬁnd the mean of a set of numbers,
1. 
Find the sum of all the numbers.
2. 
Divide this sum by the number of numbers.
The mean is the most frequently-used ‘average’.
It is important because it considers every piece of 
data. However, it can be affected by extreme values.
The mean of the numbers  12, 14, 10, 17, 21 and 22 is:
Mean  !    12  "  14  "  10  "  17  "  21  "  22

The average or mean mark of this distribution is found by dividing the total number of marks 
by the total number of pupils.
To ﬁnd the total number of marks, we multiply each mark (or  v ariable ) by the number of 
pupils (  frequency ) who received that mark.

While it is not possible to ﬁnd the exact mean of a grouped frequency distribution, we 
can ﬁnd an estimate of the mean by taking the  mid-interval value  of each class.  
The mid-interval value in the (1–5) class is found by adding 1 and 5 and dividing by 2, 
i.e.,    1  "  5

3. The Median
To ﬁnd the median of a list of numbers, put the numbers in order of 
size, starting with the smallest. The  median  is the middle number.
If there are 11 numbers in the list, the middle value 
is   1   _  
2   (11  "  1), i.e., the 6th value.
If there are 10 numbers in the list, the middle number is
  1   _  
2   (10  "  1), i.e., the 5  1   _  
2   th value.
This value is half the sum of the 5th and 6th values.
.
Write the numbers 
in order of size to 
ﬁnd the median.

If there are  n  
numbers in a list, 
the middle value is 
  1   _  
2   ( n   "  1).
If    1   _  
2   ( n   "  1)  !  4,  
then the 4th value 
is the median.
Write the numbers 
in order of size to 
ﬁnd the median.

--- Page 382 ---

The  mode  is the number of letters (in the word) that occurs most frequently.
Thus the mode is 5 as it occurs more often than any other number.
The  median  is the middle number in the distribution.
The total frequency is  3  "  4  "  9  "  5  "  2, i.e., 23.
The middle value of the 23 values is    1   _  
2   (23  "  1), i.e., the 12th value.
We take the frequency row and ﬁnd the column that contains the 12th number.
The sum of the ﬁrst two frequencies is  3  "  4  !  7.
The sum of the ﬁrst three frequencies is  3  "  4  "  9  !  16.
Thus the 12th value occurs in the third column, where the number of letters in the word is 5.
!  the median  !  5
When dealing with grouped frequency distributions, we use the same procedure to ﬁnd the 
class interval  in which the median lies.
Deciding which average to use  
The three averages, the  mean , the  mode  and the  median , are all useful but one may be more 
appropriate than the others in different situations.
The  mode  is useful when you want to know, for example, which shoe size is the most common.
The  mean  is useful for ﬁnding a ‘typical’ value when most of the data is closely grouped. The 
mean may not give a typical value if the data is very spread out or if it includes a few values 
that are very different from the rest. These values are known as  outliers .
Take, for example, a small company where the chief executive earns  € 12 100 a month and the 
other eleven employees each earn  € 2500 a month.
Here the mean monthly salary is  € 3300 which is not typical of the monthly salaries.
In situations like this, the  median  or middle value may be more typical.
The table below, which compares the advantages and disadvantages of each type of average, 
should help you make the correct decision.
Average
Advantages
Disadvantages
Mode
>  Easy to ﬁnd
>  Not inﬂuenced by extreme 
values
>  May not exist
>  Not very useful for further 
analysis
Median
>  Unaffected by extremes
>  Easy to calculate if data is 
ordered
>  Not always a given data value
>  Not very useful for further 
analysis
Mean
>  Uses all the data
>  Easy to calculate
>  Very useful for further 
analysis
>  Distorted by extreme results
>  Mean is not always a given 
data value

--- Page 383 ---

Outliers  
An outlier is a very high or very low value that is not typical of the other values in a data set. 
If the data set is small, an outlier can have a signiﬁcant effect on the mean.

Section 10.5  Measures of variability  
When dealing with  averages  in the previous section, we were looking for a data value that 
was typical or representative of all the data values.
In this section, we will discuss the measure of the spread of the data about the mean to help 
us describe the data more fully.
The three most common ways of measuring the spread or  variability  of data are the  range , 
the  interquartile range  and  standard deviation .
1. The range
The  range  of a set of data is the highest value of the set 
minus the lowest value.
It shows the  spread  of the data.
It is very useful when  comparing two sets of data.
The range is a crude measure of spread because it uses only 
the largest and smallest value of the data.
The range of the numbers  14, 18, 11, 27, 21, 19, 33, 24  is
Range  !  33  #  11  !  22
2. Quartiles and Interquartile range
When data is arranged in order of size, we have already learned that the median is the value 
halfway into the data. So we can say that the median divides the data into two halves.
The data can also be divided into four quarters.
When the data is arranged in ascending order of size:
>  the  lower quartile  is the value one quarter of the way into the data
>  the  upper quartile  is the value three quarters of the way into the data
>  the upper quartile minus the lower quartile is called the  interquartile range .
The lower quartile is written  Q 1 ; the median is  Q 2 ; the upper quartile is  Q 3 .
Consider the following data which is arranged in order of size. It contains 15 numbers.
The range of a set of 
data is the largest value 
minus the smallest value.

the value one quarter

The lower quartile  Q 1   !  5.
The median  Q 2   !  12.
The upper quartile  Q 3   !  14.
The interquartile range  !   Q 3   #   Q 1   !  14  #  5  !  9.
When  n  data values are written in order:
>  the lower quartile,  Q 1 , is the    1   _  
4   ( n   "  1)th value
>  the median,  Q 2 , is the    1   _  
2   ( n   "  1)th value
>  the upper quartile,  Q 3 , is the    3   _  
4   ( n   "  1)th value.
If you get a non-integer value for    1   _  
4   ( n   "  1) or    3   _  
4   ( n   "  1), e.g., 3  3   _  
4   , ﬁnd the mean of the 3rd and 
4th pieces of data.
If you get a non-integer for    1   _  
2   ( n   "  1), take the mean of the two data values on either side.
For example if    1   _  
2   ( n   "  1)  !  3  1   _  
2   , ﬁnd the mean of the 3rd and 4th data values.
The interquartile range is 
upper quartile  #  lower quartile
!   Q 3   #   Q 1

--- Page 388 ---

3. Standard deviation
One of the most important and frequently-used measures of spread is called  standard deviation . 
It shows how much variation there is from the average (mean). It may be thought of as the 
average difference of the scores from the mean, that is, how far they are away from the mean. 
A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean; a high 
standard deviation indicates that the data is spread out over a large range of values.
The Greek letter  $  is used to denote standard deviation.
Take, for example, all adult men in Ireland.  
The average height is about 177 cm with a  
standard deviation of about 8 cm. 
For this large population, about 68% of the  
men have a height within 8 cm of the mean.
Procedure for ﬁnding the standard deviation  
The steps used to ﬁnd the standard deviation of a set of numbers are as follows:
1.  
Calculate the mean of the numbers. This is written   _   x  .
2.  
Find the deviation (or difference) of each variable,  x , from the mean.  
This is denoted by ( x   #    _   x  ).
3.  
Square each of these deviations, i.e., ﬁnd ( x   #    _   x  )  2  .
4.  
Find the sum ( Σ ) of these values, i.e., ﬁnd  Σ ( x   #    _   x  )  2  .
5.  
Divide this result by  n , the number of numbers.
This gives    Σ ( x   #    _  x  )  2    
_________  
n  
  .
6.  
Finally, get the square root of the result in  5 .
There is no need to use this formula if you can  
remember the steps listed above.  
Alternatively, you may use a calculator.
If the mean is   _   x  and  $  is the standard 
deviation of a large sample, then 68% 
will lie between   _   x  "   $  and   _   x  #   $

--- Page 389 ---

Finding the Standard Deviation of a Frequency Distribution  
When ﬁnding the standard deviation from a frequency distribution, the deviation of each 
variable from the mean is squared and then multiplied by the frequency (  f   ) of that variable.  
The result is then divided by the sum of the frequencies. 
Finally, we get the square root of the result.
This procedure can be represented by the formula
  √
__________
 
  Σ f ( x   #    _  x  )  2    
__________  
Σ f  
       
where  Σ f ( x   #    _   x  )  2  is the sum of the  f ( x   #    _   x  )  2  column and 
Σ f  is the sum of the frequencies.
The worked example below will show you how to lay out your work when ﬁnding the 
standard deviation of a frequency distribution.
Note:  
To calculate the standard deviation of a grouped frequency distribution, take the 
mid-interval values of the variables and proceed as in Example 3 above.

--- Page 390 ---

Use of calculator to ﬁnd standard deviation  
The tedious work involved in calculating the standard deviation of a large set  
of data can be substantially reduced by using a scientiﬁc calculator.
In the following examples, we will use the  Casio fx-83ES  calculator  
to illustrate the keys and steps involved in ﬁnding standard deviation.

--- Page 391 ---

4. Percentiles
Percentiles  divide data into 100 equal parts.
Percentiles give a measure of your position relative to others in a data set. If you are told that 
you are on the 70th percentile in a competitive test, this means that 70% of the competitors 
had scores lower than yours (or 30% higher than yours). It is important not to confuse 
percentiles with percentages. For example, you could achieve a score of 70% in a state 
examination but you could be at the 80th percentile.
Percentiles are denoted by  P 1  ,  P 2  ,  P 3  ,  P 40  …
How to ﬁnd  P k  of a data set  
When asked to ﬁnd the 40th percentile,  P 40 , we are required to ﬁnd the value of the number 
that is 40% of the way into the data set.
Thus to ﬁnd  P k  of a data set:
1.  
Order the numbers in the data set from smallest to largest.
2.  
Now ﬁnd  k % of the total number of data points in the set.
 
i.e. ﬁnd    k  
____  
100   %   n , where  n  is the number of numbers in the set.
3.  
(i) If the answer in  2  is a whole number, for example 5, then the  k th percentile is the 
mean of the 5th and 6th numbers in the data set.
 (ii) If the answer in  2  is not a whole number, for example 6  1   _  
4   , round up to 7.  
The 7th number in the data set will be the  k th percentile.

Section 10.6  Stem and leaf diagrams (stemplots)  
A  stem and leaf diagram  is a very useful way of presenting data. It is useful because it shows 
all the original data and also gives you the overall picture or shape of the distribution.
It is similar to a horizontal bar chart, with the numbers themselves forming the bars.
Stem and leaf diagrams are suitable only for small amounts of data.
Often the stem shows the tens digit of the values and the leaves show the units digit.  
If you put them together, you get the original value.
For example  4 | 2  represents  42.

Back-to-back stem and leaf diagrams  
Two stem and leaf diagrams can be drawn using the same stem.
These are known as  back-to-back stem and leaf diagrams .
The leaves of one set of data are put to the right of the stem.
The leaves of the other set of data are put on the left.
A back-to-back stem and leaf diagram is very useful to compare two sets of data.
Jack and Ciara compared the length of time they spent each evening on their homework.

Their times are shown in this back-to-back stem and leaf diagram.

The following example shows how a back-to-back stem and leaf diagram can be used to 
compare two sets of data. 
Sometimes the key is 
given as 5 | 3 | 6. 
This means 35 for 
Jack and 36 for Ciara.

Finding the interquartile range from a stem and leaf diagram  
In Section 10.5 of this chapter, we found that the lower quartile is the value in the data that 
is one quarter way through the distribution. The upper quartile is the value that is three 
quarters way through the distribution. The difference between the upper quartile and the 
lower quartile is the  interquartile range .
We will now show how to ﬁnd the two quartiles and the interquartile range of a distribution 
presented as a stem and leaf diagram.

Section 10.7  Histograms  
One of the most common ways of representing a frequency distribution is by means of a 
histogram .
Histograms are very similar to bar charts but there are some important differences:
>  there are no gaps between the bars in a histogram
>  histograms are used to show  continuous data
>  the data is always  grouped ; the groups are called classes
>  the  area  of each bar or rectangle represents the frequency.
Histograms may have equal or unequal class intervals.
For our course, we will conﬁne our study to histograms with  equal class intervals .
When the class intervals are equal, drawing a histogram is very similar to drawing a bar chart.

--- Page 404 ---

Note:
If a table of results does not contain equal class-intervals proceed as follows:

Section 10.8  The shape of a distribution  
In the previous section, we encountered histograms of various shapes.
The diagrams below show four histograms, all with different shapes.
A
B
C
D
Only histogram D appears balanced or symmetrical as it has an axis of symmetry.  
The other three histograms are less balanced or  skewed  in some way.
Histograms are very useful when you want to see where the data lies and so get a clear picture of 
the shape of the distribution. For example, in histogram A above, we can see that most of the data 
is concentrated at the lower values. In histogram C, the data is concentrated at the higher values.
There are some shapes that occur frequently in distributions and you should be able to 
recognize and name them. The most common and frequently occurring shapes follow.
1. Symmetrical distributions
>  This distribution has an axis of symmetry down the middle.  
It is called a symmetrical (or bell-shaped) distribution.

>  Real-life examples of a symmetrical (or normal) distribution are
 
(i) the heights of a random sample of people
 
(ii) the intelligence quotients (IQ) of a population.

--- Page 407 ---

2. Positive skew
>  When a distribution has most of the data at the lower values, 
we say it has a  positive skew . The following histogram shows 
a positive skew as most of the data, represented by the higher 
bars, is mainly to the left.
Notice that there is a long tail to the right of the distribution.
>  Real-life examples of a distribution with a  
positive skew are
 
(i) the number of children in a family
 
(ii) the age at which people ﬁrst learn to ride a bicycle
 
(iii) the age at which people marry.
3. Negative skew
>  When a distribution has most of the data at the higher values, we say that the distribution 
has a  negative skew . 
When a distribution has a negative skew, the tail will be to the left.

4. Uniform distributions
In a uniform distribution, the data is evenly spread throughout.
It does not have a modal class.
5. Bimodal distributions
This distribution has two modes.
It is called a  bimodal distribution .
The modes are 6 and 16.
A distribution that has three or more modes is said  
to be  multimodal .

In distribution B , the data is more spread out and further from the mean than the data in
distribution A .
The more spread out the data is in a distribution, the greater the standard deviation will be.
In the distributions above, we can conclude that B  has a higher standard deviation than A .
In the two distributions C  and D  below, the mean  (  is given in each.

Section 11.1   The equation of a circle with  
centre (0, 0)   
Deﬁnition
A circle is a set of points equidistant from a given  
point called the  centre .
[OP] is always equal in length to the radius.
The circle on the right has centre (0, 0)  
and radius  r .
Let P( x ,  y ) be any point on the circle.
In the given right-angled triangle  
we have,
x 2   !   y 2   "   r  2 .
This is the  equation  of the circle with 
centre (0, 0) and radius  r .
To ﬁnd the equation of a circle, we require
 (i) the centre of the circle  (ii)  the length of the radius.

If we are given the centre and the equation of a tangent  
to the circle, then the radius is found by getting the  
length of the perpendicular from the centre of  
the circle to the tangent.

Section 11.2   Equations of a circle with centres

Section 11.3  Finding the equation of a circle   
To ﬁnd the equation of a circle we generally require,
(i)  the centre and (ii)  the radius of the circle.
In the more difﬁcult questions these two pieces of information are not given directly. We have 
to rely, therefore, on our knowledge of the geometry of the circle to ﬁnd the centre and the 
radius.
Three geometrical properties of the circle are particularly important.

--- Page 428 ---

1. The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord  
bisects the chord
In the given ﬁgure, CM  ⊥  AB
| AM |   "   | MB |
The corollary to this theorem is property 2,  
given below.
2. The perpendicular bisector of a chord contains the centre
In the given diagram,  l  is the perpendicular bisector of the  
chord [AB] and  m  is the perpendicular bisector of the  
chord [BC].
Each of these bisectors contains the centre, O.
The point of intersection of these two perpendicular  
bisectors is the centre of the circle.
Note:  
This property is very useful when we require the  
equation of a circle containing three given points.
3. The perpendicular to a tangent at the point of contact  
passes through the centre of the circle
In the given diagram the tangent,  t , touches the circle  
at the point P.
The perpendicular to  t  through P contains the centre O.

Alternative method
The equation of a circle containing three points can also be found by using the general 
equation of the circle,  x 2   !   y 2   !  2 gx   !  2 fy   !   c   "  0. By substituting the three sets of values for 
x  and  y  we will then have 3 simultaneous equations.
This is illustrated in the following example.

--- Page 430 ---

Note:  
If one of the three points on a circle is (0, 0), the method of ﬁnding the equation 
shown in Example 2 may be easier than the method shown in Example 1.

3. Equation of circle through two given points with its centre on a 
given line
The given diagram shows a circle  k  containing two 
points A and B and a line  l  which contains the centre 
of  k .
The centre of the circle is found by getting the point of 
intersection of  l  and the perpendicular bisector of [AB].

Note 
1.  The question in Example 4 may also be done by using the general equation  
x 2   !   y 2   !  2 gx   !  2 fy   !   c   "  0.
By substituting the points (1, 1) and (2,  # 1) we get two equations in  g ,  f  and  c . 
Since the line 3 x   #   y   #  7  "  0 contains the centre ( # g ,  # f  ), we get the equation  
# 3 g   !   f   #  7  "  0.
We then solve the three equations to get the values of  g ,  f  and  c .
2.  A line is a tangent to a circle if it touches the circle at  
one point only.
Also, the perpendicular distance from the centre of a  
circle to a tangent is equal to the radius of the circle.
3.   Showing that a line is a tangent to a circle
A line is a tangent to a circle if the perpendicular  
distance from the centre of the circle to the line  
is equal to the radius.

Section 11.4  Tangents to a circle   
A line is a tangent to a circle if it intersects the circle at  
one and only one point.
1.  Finding the equation of the tangent to a circle at the point P  
on the circle
In the given diagram,  t  is a tangent to the circle at  
the point P and C is the centre of the circle.
CP is perpendicular to  t .
To ﬁnd the equation of  t :
 (i) Find the slope of CP.
 (ii) Write down the slope of  t .
 (iii) Find the equation of  t  using
y   #   y 1   "   m ( x   #   x 1 ).

3. Tangents to a circle from a point P not on the circle
The diagram below illustrates that two tangents can be drawn to a circle from a point outside 
the circle, i.e. PA and PB are tangents to the circle  k .

If we are asked to ﬁnd the equations of the two tangents from the point (2, 3), for example, to 
a given circle, we ﬁrst ﬁnd in terms of the slope,  m , the equation of any line through (2, 3).

--- Page 438 ---

This equation is  y   #  3  "   m ( x   #  2)
i.e.  mx   #   y   !  3  # 2 m   "  0.
We then ﬁnd the perpendicular distance from the centre of the circle to this line and equate it 
to the radius to ﬁnd the two values of  m .
Remember     
The perpendicular distance from the  
point ( x 1 ,  y 1 ) to the line

When dealing with problems involving tangents, it is important to remember that the line 
joining the centre of the circle to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent.

We will use this information to ﬁnd the length of a  
tangent to a circle from a given point. 
This is illustrated in the following example.
To ﬁnd the length of the tangent [PT],
  | CP | 2   "   | PT | 2   !   | CT | 2
⇒   | PT | 2   "   | CP | 2   #   | CT | 2

Section 11.5  Lines and circles: Common chord   
1. Points of intersection of a line and a circle
We use simultaneous equations to ﬁnd the point(s) of intersection of a line and a circle.
If there are two solutions, then the line intersects the circle at two points.
If there is only one point of intersection, the line is a tangent to the circle, as shown below.

2. Where a circle intersects the axes
A circle intersects the  x -axis at the points where  y   "  0.
A circle intersects the  y -axis at the points where  x   "  0.
3. The common chord or common tangent of two circles
Take the circles  s 1 :  x 2   !   y 2   #  4 x   #  2 y   #  4  "  0
 
and  s 2 :  x 2   !   y 2   #  6 x   !  4 y   #  3  "  0
 
s 1   #   s 2 :  
2 x   #  6 y   #  1  "  0

--- Page 444 ---

This is the equation of the line which passes through the points of intersection of the two 
circles.
 (i) If the two circles intersect, then the line is the  common chord  of the two circles.
 (ii) If the circles touch internally or externally, then the line is the  common tangent .
Common chord
Common tangent
The points of intersection of two circles may be found by following these steps:
 (i) ﬁnd the equation of the common chord
 (ii) ﬁnd the points of intersection of the chord and any one of the circles.
The common chord 
of two circles  s 1   "  0 
and  s 2   "  0 is
s 1   #   s 2   "  0.
Note: 
The points of intersection of the two circles in Example 4 above are found by solving 
the equations 4 x   #  3 y   #  5  "  0 and  x 2   !   y 2   #  6 x   !  2 y   !  4  "  0.

Section 11.6  Touching circles – Chords and circles   
1. Circles touching externally or internally
Two circles touch if they meet at one point only.
If two circles touch  externally , then the distance 
between their centres is equal to the sum of their 
radii. In the given diagram  d  is the distance between 
the two centres.  
Since the circles touch externally,
d   "   r 1   !   r 2
If two circles touch  internally,  then the distance 
between their centres is equal to the difference of 
their radii.  
In the given diagram,
d   "   r 1   #   r 2
2. Chords and circles
We have already encountered the very useful geometrical property of the circle  
which states that:
The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord.

The inequality symbols  ! ,  " ,  # ,  $  are needed when  
solving problems in which a range of possible values  
satisfy the given conditions.
e.g. If 3 x   %  4  !  5,
 
3 x   !  9,
 
and  x   !  3,  which means that  all values of  x   
greater than 3 satisfy 3 x   %  4  !  5.
An expression such as 3 x   %  4  !  5 is called an  inequality .
Basic rules of inequalities  
Adding or subtracting a 
constant,  a  
x   !   y
x   &   a   !   y   &   a
Multiplying or dividing 
by a  positive  number, 
a   !  0
x   !   y
ax   !   ay
  x  
__   a  !    y  
__   a 
When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality symbol is  reversed .
E.g. 5  !  2 ; if both sides are multiplied by ( % 1), we get 5  '  ( % 1)  #  2  '  ( % 1), i.e.  % 5  #   % 2.
Multiplying or dividing 
by a  negative  number, 
a   #  0
x   !   y
ax   #   ay
  x  
__   a  #    y  
__   a 
!  greater than

Graphical construction  
If a graph of the function is given or is easily constructed, this provides an extra technique in 
helping to understand and solve inequalities.
If  f   ( x )  !   ( x   "  3)( x   #  1)( x   #  4)  "  0 ,

then the points  x   (   % 3,  x   (  1 and  x   (  4 are the  
critical points in determining  the solution set.
The set of values of  x  for which 
f  ( x )   (  ( x   )   3)( x   %   1)( x   %   4)   "   5
can also be estimated.
Note:
 (i)  When solving inequalities, the solution is often restricted to speciﬁc number systems,  
i.e.  $   N ,  $   Z ,  $   R , and the resulting range of numbers plotted on the number line.  
e.g. 5 x   %  1  !  14,  x   $   N .
 (ii)  An inequality creates an ordered pair ( a ,  b );  
If  a   !   b , then if the order is reversed ( b ,  a ), the inequality is also reversed, i.e.  b   #   a .

Section 12.2  Quadratic and rational inequalities   
1. Quadratic inequalities
ax 2   "   bx   "   c   "   0  is an example of a quadratic inequality.
To solve a quadratic inequality of the form  ax 2   )   bx   )   c   "  0 (or  $  0), proceed  
as follows:
1. Solve  ax 2   )   bx   )   c   (  0 to ﬁnd the (real) roots of the quadratic equation.
2. Draw a rough sketch of the graph using these roots. 
 
 (i) If  a   !  0, the graph is  % -shaped.
 
 (ii) If  a   #  0, the graph is  & -shaped.
3. Use the graph to ﬁnd the set of values of  x  that satisﬁes the inequality.

--- Page 461 ---

Questions involving values for which the roots of an equation are real,  
i.e.  b 2   %  4 ac   "  0, result in quadratic inequalities as shown in the following example.
2. Rational inequalities
f  ( x )  (    3 x   %  2  
______  
x   )  1   is a  rational function  as the denominator and numerator are 
both polynomials in  x .
  3 x   %  2  
______  
x   )  1    "   2 is a  rational inequality .
Since we do not know if ( x   )  1) is positive or negative, we cannot simply multiply  
both sides by ( x   )  1) when solving for  x  as the inequality symbol would have to be 
reversed if ( x   )  1) was negative.
However, if we multiply both sides by ( x   )  1) 2 , we can retain the same inequality  
sign since ( x   )  1) 2  is always positive.
⇒    3 x   %  2  
______  
x   )  1    '  ( x   )  1) 2   "  2  '  ( x   )  1) 2
⇒  (3 x   %  2)( x   )  1)  "  2( x 2   )  2 x   )  1)
⇒  3 x 2   )   x   %  2  "  2 x 2   )  4 x   )  2
⇒   x 2   %  3 x   %  4  "  0 ,  creating a quadratic inequality (with the same solution set) 
from the rational inequality.

Section 12.3  Modulus  
1. Modular equations
The modulus of a number is a measure of its size or  
If  | x |   (   a  ,  then 
x   (   ) a  or  % a   
and  | x | 2   (   a 2 .
 
magnitude and is written as  |  x  | .
| 3 |   (  3,  | % 4 |   (  4,  | 15.5 |   (  15.5,  | % 6.2 |   (  6.2 . . . . in other  
words, for all  x   $   R ,  |   x |  is the positive value of the number.
Conversely, if  | x |   (  6, then  x   (   ) 6 or  % 6.
And therefore,  | x | 2   (  36.
Geometrically, the modulus function multiplies any negative part of the graph by ( % 1). 
Compare the following graphs:

The graph of  f  ( x )  (   | x |  is found from the graph of  f  ( x )  (   x  by reﬂecting, in the  x -axis, 
that part of the graph for which  f  ( x )  #  0.

--- Page 466 ---

Note 1:   The method of “squaring both sides” of a modular equation can be useful when  
the modulus sign appears on both sides of the equation, e.g.  | 3 x   )  5 |   (   | x   %  2 | . 
Note 2:   Getting the modulus of an expression is sometimes referred to as getting  
the  absolute value  of the expression. 
2. Modular inequalities
If  | x |   #  1, then the value of  x  must lie between  ) 1 and  % 1, i.e.  % 1  #   x  #   ) 1.
If  | x |   !  1, then the value of  x  must lie outside this range, i.e.  x   !  1 or  x   #   % 1. 

--- Page 467 ---

Note :  If  | 2 x   %  5 |   (  3, then 2 x   %  5  (  3 or 2 x   %  5  (% 3.
 
If  | 2 x   %  5 |   #  3, then  % 3  #  2 x   %  5  #  3.
!  2  #  2 x   #  8  … adding 5 to each part of the inequality
1  #   x   #  4  … dividing each part of the inequality by 2
This produces the same solution set as above.

Section 12.4  Mathematical proof  
In mathematics, we use deductive reasoning to prove that a statement is  always  true.
The statement, when proved true, then becomes a theorem. e.g. Pythagoras’ theorem.
The different methods of proof include direct proofs, proofs by contradiction and proofs  
by induction (see Section 12.12).

--- Page 470 ---

1. Direct proof
Direct proof uses axioms, deﬁnitions and other proven theorems to verify the  
new statement.
2. Proof by contradiction
In a proof by contradiction, we show that if we claim some statement to be true, then a 
logical contradiction occurs which proves that the original statement must be false.

--- Page 471 ---

Section 12.5  Proofs of abstract inequalities  
If  a   !  0 and  b   !  0, then   a  
__  
b   )    b 
__  
a   "  2 is an example of an  abstract inequality  (see Example 2).
To prove that an inequality statement is true, we will use two important facts:
 
(i) (Any real number) 2   "  0
 (ii)  % (Any real number) 2   $  0.
If both sides of an inequality are squared,  
the inequality sign is retained only if both sides  
of the inequality are positive.
For example, 4  !  3  ⇒  4 2   !  3 2 , i.e. 16  !  9.
However, if one or both sides are negative,  
then this does not hold.
E.g. 2  !   % 3  ⇏  2 2   !  ( % 3) 2 ,
i.e. 4  *  9.
To prove an abstract inequality;
1. Write down the statement you are asked to prove.
2. Use the rules of inequalities to adapt the inequality until …
3. you arrive at an inequality that is obviously true.
If  a  and  b  are real numbers, then
a 2   "  0 and  b 2   "  0
 
( a   )   b ) 2   "  0
 
( a   %   b ) 2   "  0
  % ( a   )   b ) 2   $  0
  % ( a   %   b ) 2   $  0

Section 12.6  Indices  
When a number is multiplied by itself many times, we use the index form to represent  
the product.
4  '  4  '  4  '  4  '  4  (  4 5 , i.e. 4 to the power of 5.
In this case, 5 is the  index  (plural indices)   and 4 is the  base   number .

Numerical expressions containing complex fractions with indices  
 
can be simpliﬁed and evaluated with a calculator. 
Since the procedure on each calculator may be slightly different,  
it is important to gain practice on your calculator, particularly when  
dealing with fractional powers. 
However, it is most important to understand the rules of indices  
and to be able to apply them to general problems containing unknowns.

Section 12.7  Exponential equations  
 y   (  3 x   is an example of an exponential function.
 3 x   (  27 is an example of an  exponential equation .
As in the last section, 3 is the  base number  and  x  is the  index  (power) or  exponent. 
When solving exponential equations, it is important to identify the base number (usually a 
prime number) that is common to all the individual terms of the equation. 
E.g. 3 x   (  27 ; 3 is the base number for both sides.  … (3 x   (  3 3 )
 25 x   (  125 ; 5 is the base number.  … (5 x   (  5 3 )
By using a suitable  change of variable,  an 
exponential equation can be transformed into a 
quadratic equation and then solved.

Section 12.8  Exponential functions  
Exponential functions such as  f  ( x )   !   a x   are used in modelling many physical occurrences. 
These include: 
 (i) the growth of a biological cell
 (ii) changes in population, e.g. algae growth on stagnant water 
 (iii) compounded interest and depreciation
 (iv) radioactive decay
 (v) the rate at which a body loses heat (Newton’s law of cooling).
ICT:  Functions of the form  y   (   a  x ,  a   (  constant, can be studied 
graphically. Remember, when using a keyboard, to use the “^” 
button to raise a power (exponent), i.e.  y   (  2 ^  x .  
Proper use of brackets is essential, i.e.  y   (  2 ^ (2 x )  (  2 2 x .
All of the graphs associated with exponential functions have a characteristic shape and  
are easily identiﬁed. From this diagram we can see

The magnitude (or size)  M  of an earthquake is measured on a scale called the Richter scale.
During earthquakes, the amplitude ( A ) of the earth’s movement is a measure of the 
intensity ( I ) of the quake i.e.  I   "   A  and is given by the exponential formula  I   (   k 10 M , where 
k  is a constant.
The energy released by the earthquake of magnitude  M  is  E   (  10 1.5 M  )  4.4  joules

An earthquake of magnitude 2 on the Richter scale releases 25,118,864 Joules of energy.

Section 12.9  Logarithmic function  
The  logarithm  is a function that focuses on the index (or exponent) of a number.
If  y   (  2 5 , then  y   (  32 is easily calculated.
However, if 200  (  2 x
,  it is not as easy to ﬁnd the index  x  that gives the number 200.
To ﬁnd  x , we use logarithms ( logs  for short).
Consider the result 32  (  2 5  ; using log notation,  log 2 32   !   5.  
This is read as “the log of 32 to the base 2 is 5”,
i.e.,  5 is the index (power)  to which the base number 2 must be raised to get 32.
Similarly, 10 2   ( 100 can be rewritten using logs as log 10 100  (  2
(the log of 100 in the base 10 is 2),
i.e.,  2 is the index (power)  to which the base number 10 must be raised to get 100.
Thus, the equations 2 3   (  8 and log 2 8  (  3 are  identical   and   interchangeable .
Index form

100  (  10 2
log 10  100  (  2
200  (  2 x
log 2  200  (   x
From this deﬁnition of a log, it is clear that 
(i)  log 5 25  (  2  (ii) log 3 27  (  3  (iii) log 2 16  (  4  (iv) log 3 81  (  4, 
i.e. to what power must 5 be raised, to get 25 …? Answer  (  2 … etc.
If the log or base is not a whole number, proceed as follows. 
The  logarithm  of a number is the 
power  to which the base number 
must be raised to get that number.
a x   !   y  is equivalent to  log  a  y   !   x

1. The laws of logarithms
When the rules of indices are expressed in  
logarithm form, we produce the very important  
laws of logarithms. 
These laws enable us to solve many  
complex equations.
Using your calculator,   verify each of the following. 
1. log 10 4  )  log 10 3  (  log 10 12  (  1.0792
2. log 10 8  %  log 10 6  (  log 10   ( #   8  
__   6  )   (  0.1249
3. log 10 8 3  (  3 log 10 8  (  2.7093
4. log 10 10  (  1
5. log 10 1  (  0
The rules of logs apply to any base, however, the two most widely-used bases in logs  
are the base 10 and the base e (2.718).
Base ten logs, e.g.  log 10 1000,  are used for calculation purposes and are referred to  
as  common logs .
Base  e  ( (  2.718), e.g.  log e 1000 , is used when dealing with naturally-occurring events,  
e.g. earthquakes, growth of colonies etc., and hence are called  natural logs  and are  
written  log e  x  !   ln   x .

2. Solving logarithmic equations
•  When solving log equations, always check that each term has the same base.  
If this is not the case,  the change of base rule  must ﬁrst be used to change to  
a common base.
•  If no base is given, the equation holds true for all bases.
•  If log a b   (  log a c , then  b   (   c .
•  If log a b   (   k , then  b   (   a k .
•  Check all solutions to make sure they do not produce logs of negative numbers  
as these are not deﬁned. (See page 492.)
The log of a 
number to its 
own base is 1.

Section 12.11   Problem-solving with exponential and  
log functions  
As stated already, exponential and log functions are used to model a wide variety of 
problems.
The loudness of sounds, the acidity of a solution and the intensity of earthquakes on the 
Richter scale are some examples, among many, of their application.

Compound interest (increasing value)  
The ﬁnal value,  € A, of a sum of money,  € P, invested at a rate of  i  (expressed in decimal form) 
compound interest for  t  years, is given by the formula A  (  P(1  )   i  ) t . It is often required that 
we calculate the time,  t  (the index),   for a particular investment to mature. This can be done 
by using logs as follows;
If 
A  (  P(1  )   i  ) t ,
⇒  
  A  
__  
P    (  (1  )   i  ) t   … dividing both sides by P
⇒  ln   ( #   A  
__  
P    )   (  ln(1  )   i  ) t   … taking the natural log of both sides
⇒  ln   ( #   A  
__  
P    )   (   t . ln(1  )   i  )  … lnB n   (   n . lnB

Depreciation (reducing value)  
If a quantity reduces by a ﬁxed amount over a given term (e.g. per annum), the same 
equation can be adapted to track the reducing value over time.
The present population P then becomes P  (  P 0 (1  %   i  ) t  where P 0  was the initial population.
For example, if the population of red squirrels is reducing at a rate of 5% per year, then 
P  (  P 0 (1  %  0.05) t   (  P 0 (0.95) t  is the number of red squirrels after “ t ” years.
Doubling time  
The  doubling time  is the time required for a quantity to double in size or value.
If a quantity is growing exponentially, then the number (or value) present at time  t  can be 
expressed by  y  (  A . e bt , where  A  is the amount or value at the start (i.e.  t  (  0) and  b  is a 
growth constant, speciﬁc to a particular organism.

Section 12.12  Proofs by induction  
Many theorems in mathematics are proven true using the method of mathematical induction.
To prove a statement true by induction, we follow clearly-deﬁned steps.
 (i) The statement is proven true for some ﬁxed value, usually  n   (  1 or  n   (  2.
 (ii) The statement is then assumed true for  n  (   k.
 (iii) Based on this assumption, we must show that the statement is true for  n   (   k   )  1.
 (iv) In conclusion, a “rolling proof” is formed:
a. Since it was true for  n   ( 1, 
b. it is now true for  n   (  1  )  1  (  2.
c. Since it is true for  n   (  2, it is true for  n   (  2  )  1  (  3, etc.
d. It is therefore true for all values of  n .

--- Page 499 ---

Note 1:   Although we could prove this statement true for many discrete values of  n , the 
important feature of this method of proof is that it proves the statement true  for all 
values of  n .
Note 2:   Mathematical induction is not a means of discovering a result, but when we have a 
result that seems to be true, this method provides us with a rigorous proof.
Note 3:   Proof by induction can be applied to several different categories of results 
including;
 
(i) Results involving  series of numbers  
e.g. 1  )  2  )  3  )  4  )  . . . .  n   (    n  
__  
2  ( n   )  1).
 
(ii) Results involving  factors of expressions  e.g. 10 n   %  7 n  is divisible by 3.
 
(iii) Results involving  inequalities 
e.g. 3 n   !  3 n   )  1, for  n   "  2.

Inequality proofs  
When dealing with inequalities we noted two important deductions, namely
 (i) If  a   !   b , then  a   %   b   !  0
 (ii) (any real number ) 2   !  0.
