    • Measures of variability: range → Finding quartiles in a data set
      Reason: Knowing the range aids in understanding the distribution of data, which is necessary for identifying quartiles and calculating the interquartile range.
    • Finding quartiles in a data set → Measures of variability: range
      Reason: range"

Cycle 199 (Length 3): triangle defined by three non-collinear points → convex set → triangle defined by three non-collinear points
  Relationships in this cycle:
    • triangle defined by three non-collinear points → convex set
      Reason: The definition of a triangle as a shape formed by three non-collinear points inherently involves the concept of a convex set, as any triangle is a convex shape by nature.
    • convex set → triangle defined by three non-collinear points
      Reason: Understanding the concept of a convex set is essential for defining and working with triangles, as a triangle is a specific example of a convex set formed by three non-collinear points.

Cycle 200 (Length 3): opposite angles of cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees → angles in triangles and parallelograms → opposite angles of cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees
  Relationships in this cycle:
    • opposite angles of cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees → angles in triangles and parallelograms
      Reason: Understanding that opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees helps in recognizing angle relationships in triangles and parallelograms, as both concepts involve angle properties and relationships within geometric figures.
    • angles in triangles and parallelograms → opposite angles of cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees
      Reason: Knowledge of angles in triangles and parallelograms provides foundational understanding of angle relationships, which is essential for grasping the specific case of cyclic quadrilaterals where opposite angles sum to 180 degrees.
