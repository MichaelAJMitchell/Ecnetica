# Natural Numbers and Integers

## Natural Numbers

### Theory

Let's explore the foundation of all mathematics: the natural numbers! These are the numbers we first learn as children, the counting numbers that help us make sense of the world around us. Notice how naturally they arise when we count objects, steps, or anything discrete in our daily lives.

**Foundational Definitions:** Natural numbers, denoted by $\mathbb{N}$, are the positive counting numbers that begin with 1 and continue infinitely:

$$\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...\}$$

Here's why natural numbers are so fundamental: they represent the most basic concept of quantity. When you count apples in a basket or students in a classroom, you're using natural numbers. This set is infinite - there's no largest natural number because you can always add 1 to any number to get a bigger one!

**Key Properties of Natural Numbers:**

**Well-Ordering Principle:** Every non-empty subset of natural numbers has a smallest element

• This means if you pick any collection of natural numbers, there's always a "first" one
• Example: In the set {7, 3, 12, 5}, the smallest element is 3
• This property is unique to natural numbers and doesn't hold for all number systems

**Closure Properties:** Natural numbers behave predictably under certain operations

• Addition is closed: $a + b \in \mathbb{N}$ for all $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$
• Multiplication is closed: $a \times b \in \mathbb{N}$ for all $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$
• Subtraction is NOT closed: $3 - 5 = -2 \notin \mathbb{N}$
• Division is NOT closed: $3 \div 2 = 1.5 \notin \mathbb{N}$

**Fundamental Operations and Their Properties:**

**Addition:** The operation of combining quantities

$$a + b = c \quad \text{where } a, b, c \in \mathbb{N}$$

• Commutative: $a + b = b + a$
• Associative: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
• No identity element in $\mathbb{N}$ (since $0 \notin \mathbb{N}$)

**Multiplication:** Repeated addition or scaling

$$a \times b = \underbrace{a + a + ... + a}_{b \text{ times}}$$

• Commutative: $a \times b = b \times a$
• Associative: $(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$
• Identity element: $1$ (since $a \times 1 = a$)
• Distributive over addition: $a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c$

**Special Natural Numbers and Patterns:**

**Prime Numbers:** Natural numbers greater than 1 with exactly two factors

$$p \text{ is prime if } p > 1 \text{ and factors of } p = \{1, p\}$$

• Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29...
• Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Every natural number > 1 can be uniquely factored into primes

**Perfect Squares:** Numbers of the form $n^2$

$$1^2 = 1, \quad 2^2 = 4, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, ...$$

**Factorial Numbers:** Products of consecutive natural numbers

$$n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times ... \times 2 \times 1$$

$$\text{Example: } 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$$

### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Counting Arrangements

Let's work through this problem step by step: In how many ways can we arrange 6 different books on a shelf?

**Method 1: The Multiplication Principle**

Here's how we approach this: for each position on the shelf, we count how many choices we have.

$$\text{First position: } 6 \text{ choices} \quad \text{(Any of the 6 books can go first)}$$

$$\text{Second position: } 5 \text{ choices} \quad \text{(5 books remain after placing the first)}$$

$$\text{Third position: } 4 \text{ choices} \quad \text{(4 books remain)}$$

$$\text{Continuing this pattern...}$$

$$\text{Total arrangements: } 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720 \quad \text{(This is 6! in factorial notation)}$$

**Method 2: Understanding Through Smaller Cases**

Notice what happens when we build up from simpler cases:

$$1 \text{ book: } 1 \text{ way} = 1!$$

$$2 \text{ books: } 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ ways} = 2!$$

$$3 \text{ books: } 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \text{ ways} = 3!$$

$$\text{Pattern: } n \text{ books can be arranged in } n! \text{ ways}$$

##### Example 2: Prime Factorization

Let's find the prime factorization of 84. This might look tricky at first, but we'll break it down systematically.

**Method 1: Factor Tree Approach**

$$84 = 2 \times 42 \quad \text{(Divide by smallest prime)}$$

$$84 = 2 \times 2 \times 21 \quad \text{(42 is even, so divide by 2 again)}$$

$$84 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 7 \quad \text{(21 = 3 × 7, both prime)}$$

$$84 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 7 \quad \text{(Final prime factorization)}$$

**Method 2: Systematic Division**

Here's a helpful way to think about it - keep dividing by primes in order:

$$84 \div 2 = 42 \quad \text{(First factor of 2)}$$

$$42 \div 2 = 21 \quad \text{(Second factor of 2)}$$

$$21 \div 3 = 7 \quad \text{(Factor of 3)}$$

$$7 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{(Factor of 7, and we're done!)}$$

##### Example 3: Division with Remainders

A factory produces 365 items and needs to pack them into boxes of 24. How many full boxes can be filled, and how many items remain?

Let's solve this step by step using natural number division:

$$365 \div 24 = 15 \text{ remainder } 5 \quad \text{(Using long division)}$$

$$\text{Verification: } 24 \times 15 + 5 = 360 + 5 = 365 \quad \text{(Always check your answer!)}$$

$$\text{Answer: } 15 \text{ full boxes with } 5 \text{ items remaining}$$

The key insight here is that natural number division often leaves remainders, which is why we need the division algorithm:

$$a = bq + r \quad \text{where } 0 \leq r < b$$

## Integers

### Theory

Now let's explore how mathematicians extended the natural numbers to create a more complete number system. Here's why this was necessary: what happens when you try to subtract 7 from 5? In the natural numbers, this operation isn't possible. But in real life, we need to represent debts, temperatures below zero, and positions below sea level. This is where integers come in!

**The Set of Integers:** Integers, denoted by $\mathbb{Z}$ (from the German word "Zahlen" meaning numbers), include:

$$\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$$

Notice how integers extend infinitely in both directions. This set includes:

• **Positive integers:** $\{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$ (these are our natural numbers!)
• **Zero:** $\{0\}$ (neither positive nor negative)
• **Negative integers:** $\{-1, -2, -3, -4, ...\}$

**Why Zero is Special:**

Zero acts as the additive identity, meaning:

$$a + 0 = a \quad \text{for all } a \in \mathbb{Z}$$

It's worth taking a moment to appreciate that zero is the boundary between positive and negative numbers, and it has unique properties that make our number system work beautifully.

**Operations with Integers:**

**Addition and Subtraction:** Now fully defined for all integers

$$a - b = a + (-b) \quad \text{(Subtraction is addition of the opposite)}$$

• Example: $5 - 8 = 5 + (-8) = -3$
• Integers are closed under both addition and subtraction

**Multiplication Rules:** Let's explore how signs interact

• Positive × Positive = Positive: $(+3) \times (+4) = +12$
• Positive × Negative = Negative: $(+3) \times (-4) = -12$
• Negative × Positive = Negative: $(-3) \times (+4) = -12$
• Negative × Negative = Positive: $(-3) \times (-4) = +12$

Here's a helpful way to remember this: "Same signs give positive, different signs give negative"

**Integer Division:** Still not always possible within integers

$$\frac{a}{b} \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ only if } b \text{ divides } a \text{ evenly}$$

• Example: $\frac{12}{3} = 4 \in \mathbb{Z}$ but $\frac{12}{5} = 2.4 \notin \mathbb{Z}$

**Absolute Value:** Distance from zero on the number line

$$|a| = \begin{cases} 
a & \text{if } a \geq 0 \\
-a & \text{if } a < 0 
\end{cases}$$

• $|5| = 5$ (already positive)
• $|-5| = 5$ (remove the negative sign)
• $|0| = 0$ (zero is its own absolute value)

**Order and Comparison:**

The integers have a natural ordering that extends from the natural numbers:

$$... < -3 < -2 < -1 < 0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < ...$$

This ordering allows us to:
• Compare any two integers
• Find the maximum or minimum of a set
• Define intervals and ranges

**Important Properties of Integer Arithmetic:**

**Additive Inverse:** Every integer has an opposite

$$\text{For every } a \in \mathbb{Z}, \text{ there exists } -a \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ such that } a + (-a) = 0$$

**Distributive Property:** Multiplication distributes over addition

$$a(b + c) = ab + ac$$

$$a(b - c) = ab - ac$$

### Application

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Temperature Changes

Let's work through this problem step by step: The temperature at midnight was -5°C. It rose by 12°C during the day, then fell by 8°C in the evening. What was the final temperature?

**Method 1: Sequential Calculation**

Here's how we approach this using integer arithmetic:

$$\text{Starting temperature: } -5°C \quad \text{(Below freezing)}$$

$$\text{After rising: } -5 + 12 = 7°C \quad \text{(Adding a positive to a negative)}$$

$$\text{After falling: } 7 + (-8) = 7 - 8 = -1°C \quad \text{(Back below freezing)}$$

**Method 2: Combined Calculation**

Notice what happens when we combine all changes:

$$-5 + 12 + (-8) = -5 + 12 - 8 \quad \text{(Rewrite for clarity)}$$

$$= -5 + 4 = -1°C \quad \text{(Net change is +4°C)}$$

##### Example 2: Financial Transactions

A business account shows these transactions: starting balance €2,500, payment received €1,800, rent paid €3,200, supplies purchased €750. What's the final balance?

Let's solve this step by step, treating income as positive and expenses as negative:

$$\text{Starting balance: } +2,500 \quad \text{(Positive balance)}$$

$$\text{Payment received: } +1,800 \quad \text{(Income is positive)}$$

$$\text{Rent paid: } -3,200 \quad \text{(Expense is negative)}$$

$$\text{Supplies: } -750 \quad \text{(Another expense)}$$

$$\text{Final balance: } 2,500 + 1,800 + (-3,200) + (-750)$$

$$= 4,300 + (-3,950) \quad \text{(Group positives and negatives)}$$

$$= 350 \quad \text{(Account remains positive)}$$

##### Example 3: Elevator Movement

An elevator starts at the 3rd floor. It goes down 5 floors, up 8 floors, down 2 floors, and up 3 floors. What floor does it end on?

Here's a helpful way to track the movement using integers:

$$\text{Starting position: } +3 \quad \text{(3rd floor above ground)}$$

$$\text{Down 5: } 3 + (-5) = -2 \quad \text{(Now at 2nd basement level)}$$

$$\text{Up 8: } -2 + 8 = 6 \quad \text{(6th floor)}$$

$$\text{Down 2: } 6 + (-2) = 4 \quad \text{(4th floor)}$$

$$\text{Up 3: } 4 + 3 = 7 \quad \text{(Final position: 7th floor)}$$

The key insight here is that we can represent any position relative to ground level using integers!

### Key Takeaways

```{important}
1. **Natural numbers** ($\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$) are the counting numbers we use for quantities
2. Natural numbers are **closed under addition and multiplication** but not subtraction or division
3. **Integers** ($\mathbb{Z} = \{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\}$) extend natural numbers to include zero and negatives
4. Integers are **closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication** but not division
5. **Zero is the additive identity**: $a + 0 = a$ for all integers $a$
6. **Sign rules for multiplication**: Same signs → positive, different signs → negative
7. **Absolute value** $|a|$ represents distance from zero on the number line
8. These number systems are the foundation for all mathematics and have countless real-world applications
