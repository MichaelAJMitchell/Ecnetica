### Learning outcomes

Discuss the types of Quantum Computing Hardware and the Physical components that they are made up of as well as the guiding principle behind their operation. This leads us into a discussion into the various engineering challenges in building Quantum Computing systems and what techniques and mechaisms need to be used to tackle said challenges, we also breifly look into the Roadmaps of Quantum Hardware Companies to identify critical milestones in the path towards Universal Quantum Computing.

### Why do we need Quantum Computing?
First let us answer the question of Why we need quantum computers, There are broadly two reasons why Quantum Computing promises to be useful to us in the future of computing. 

- The first reason is that there exist a class of problems which are very difficult to solve on Classical Computers but can be efficiently calculated on a Quantum Computer. These include certain Optimization problems, Chemical Simulations and some search problems, Quantum computers can theoretically solve these problems in exponentially fewer computational steps in comparison to their classical counterpart. 
- Secondly,Classical computers and processors are getting smaller as observed by the Mooreâ€™s law, which was introduced in the previous module, the Quantum effects within the Hardware start becoming more apparent the Quantum Interactions between the individual bits start affecting the information stored in the system and therefore it is important to understand Quantum Phenomenon to build better Classical Processors in the future.
