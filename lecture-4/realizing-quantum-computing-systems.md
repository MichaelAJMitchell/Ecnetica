### Learning outcomes

Discuss the types of Quantum Computing Hardware and the Physical components that they are made up of as well as the guiding principle behind their operation. This leads us into a discussion into the various engineering challenges in building Quantum Computing systems and what techniques and mechaisms need to be used to tackle said challenges, we also breifly look into the Roadmaps of Quantum Hardware Companies to identify critical milestones in the path towards Universal Quantum Computing.
