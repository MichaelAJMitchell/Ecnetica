## Preface

This substantially revised book is the second of two volumes that amalgamate the previous editions of Text \& Tests 4, 5, 6 and 7 into two books for the Higher Level Leaving Certificate Project Maths course. Text \& Tests 5 completes the course.

This Sixth-Year textbook follows on from Text \& Tests 4. The topics of geometry, differential calculus, probability and statistics are completed. A chapter on functions is introduced and revises many of the graphs already encountered during the course.

The book fully reflects the overall approach to the teaching of Maths as stated in the learning outcomes for Project Maths. It encourages the development of not only the students' knowledge and skills but also the understanding necessary to apply these skills.

The extensive range of imaginatively written and probing questions on each topic will help students understand the concepts involved and develop their problemsolving skills. Every attempt has been made to grade the questions in order of difficulty.

At the beginning of each chapter, there is a list of Key Words that the students are expected to know and understand when the chapter is completed.

Each chapter concludes with a three-part revision exercise section consisting of (a) Core, (b) Advanced, and (c) Extended Response questions

## Complex numbers

## Key words

irrational number rational integer non-repeating non-terminating surds complex number complex conjugate polar form real imaginary rectangular form modulus-argument form de Moivre's theorem Argand diagram

## Section 1.1 Irrational numbers

In your study of maths so far, you will have met these number systems:
(i) Natural numbers: $\mathrm{N}=\{1,2,3,4, \ldots \ldots \ldots\} \ldots$ whole positive numbers.
(ii) Integers: $\mathrm{Z}=\{\ldots \ldots-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, \ldots \ldots\} \ldots$ whole, positive and negative numbers including zero.
(iii) Rational numbers: $\mathrm{Q}=\left\{\left.\frac{a}{b} \right\rvert\, a, b \in Z, b \neq 0\right\}$, i.e. fractions, e.g. $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{7}{3}, \frac{-3}{5}, \frac{6}{1}, \frac{10}{9}, \frac{-4}{2}$ etc.

Note: The set Q includes decimals that can be written as fractions.
If we try to solve the equation $x^{2}+2=7$, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^{2} & =7-2=5 \\
x & =\sqrt{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\sqrt{5}$ is a number that is not an element of any of the above sets of numbers.
Using a calculator, we find $\sqrt{5}=2.236067978 \ldots \ldots$, a non-repeating, non-terminating decimal.
Because $\sqrt{5}$ cannot be written as a ratio (fraction), it is called an irrational number.
Examples of irrational numbers are $\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{6}, \sqrt{7} \ldots$
Note: We have already described these numbers as surds.
One of the most famous irrational numbers is $\pi$, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

$$
\pi=3.141592654 \ldots \ldots . . .
$$

Another is Euler's number, $\boldsymbol{e}$, the base number of the natural logarithms.

$$
e=2.71828182845 \ldots \ldots \ldots .
$$

Definition: An irrational number is any real number that cannot be expressed in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $b$ is not zero.

Since there can be no numbers common to the rational and irrational sets, together the sets of natural numbers, integers, rational and irrational numbers form the partitioned set of Real numbers (R).

It is clear that $N \subset Z \subset Q$.
Also, $\mathrm{R} \backslash \mathrm{Q}=$ the set of irrational numbers.
Note: Not all square roots are irrational numbers, e.g. $\sqrt{4}=2, \sqrt{9}=3$ etc.
As outlined in the section on surds, irrational numbers can be simplified by finding a pair of factors, one factor of which is a perfect square.
E.g. $\sqrt{18}=\sqrt{9 \times 2}=\sqrt{9} \times \sqrt{2}=3 \sqrt{2}$.

## Example 1

Simplify each of the following, giving your answers in the form $a \sqrt{b}, a, b \in Z$.
(i) $\sqrt{48}+\sqrt{75}$
(ii) $\sqrt{180}-\sqrt{20}$
(i)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{48} & =\sqrt{16 \times 3}=\sqrt{16} \times \sqrt{3}=4 \sqrt{3} \\
\sqrt{75} & =\sqrt{25 \times 3}=\sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{3}=5 \sqrt{3} \\
\therefore \quad \sqrt{48}+\sqrt{75} & =4 \sqrt{3}+5 \sqrt{3}=9 \sqrt{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{180} & =\sqrt{36 \times 5}=6 \sqrt{5} \\
\sqrt{20} & =\sqrt{4 \times 5}=2 \sqrt{5} \\
\therefore \quad \sqrt{180}-\sqrt{20} & =6 \sqrt{5}-2 \sqrt{5}=4 \sqrt{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Constructing a line of length $\sqrt{2}$

Although $\sqrt{2}=1.414214 \ldots$ is a non-terminating decimal, it is possible to construct a line of length $\sqrt{2}$ on the number line as the following example shows.

## Example 2

Using a compass and straightedge only, construct a line segment of length $\sqrt{2}$ and hence mark $\sqrt{2}$ on the number line.
(i) Using a straightedge, draw a line segment [AM].
(ii) Starting at A , mark equal spaces $0,1,2 \ldots$ ( $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}$ ) using a compass.
(iii) Using a compass, construct the perpendicular bisector of [AC], that is, draw a perpendicular line through B.
(iv) Join D and E.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-006.jpg?height=498&width=466&top_left_y=1691&top_left_x=1073)
(v) Mark the point F on $[\mathrm{DE}]$ so that $|\mathrm{AB}|=|\mathrm{BF}|$.
(vi) Using A as the centre and $|\mathrm{AF}|$ as radius, draw an arc FG to the number line.
(vii) Mark G on the number line, $\sqrt{2}$.

Proof: Consider the triangle $A B F$ :

$$
|A B|=1,|B F|=1, A B F=90^{\circ}
$$

Using Pythagoras' theorem: $\quad|A F|^{2}=|A B|^{2}+|F B|^{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore|A F|^{2}=1^{2}+1^{2}=2 \\
& \therefore|A F|=\sqrt{2} \Rightarrow|A G|=\sqrt{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: Using similar constructions, other irrational numbers can be plotted on the number line.

## Example 3

Construct a line segment of length $\sqrt{3}$ on the number line.
(i) Mark a point A on a straight line AB .
(ii) Using a compass, mark equal spaces |AJ| and |JC| (each 1 unit) along AB .
(iii) Using $A$ as centre and $|A C|$ as radius, draw an arc.
(iv) Using C as centre and $|\mathrm{CA}|$ as radius, draw an arc.
(v) Join the points of intersection of the arcs HI.
(vi) From our geometry theorems,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-007.jpg?height=550&width=581&top_left_y=1472&top_left_x=961) we know that HI is perpendicular to AB and bisects [AC] at J .
Consider the triangle AJH.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& |\mathrm{AJ}|=1,|\mathrm{AH}|=2, \angle \mathrm{AJH}=90^{\circ} \\
& \therefore \quad|\mathrm{AH}|^{2}=|\mathrm{AJ}|^{2}+|\mathrm{JH}|^{2} \quad \ldots \text { using Pythagroas's theorem } \\
& \therefore \quad 2^{2}=1^{2}+|\mathrm{JH}|^{2} \\
& \therefore \quad 4=1+|\mathrm{JH}|^{2} \\
& \therefore \quad 3=|\mathrm{JH}|^{2} \Rightarrow|\mathrm{JH}|=\sqrt{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using J as centre and $|\mathrm{JH}|$ as radius, draw an arc HK intersecting the horizontal line at K .

$$
|\mathrm{JK}|=\sqrt{3}
$$

## Exercise 1.1

14. (i) Write down one value of $x$ for which the expression $\sqrt{3-x}$ is rational.
(ii) Describe in words the set of values of $x$ for which the expression $\sqrt{3-x}$ is rational.

## Section 1.2 Complex numbers

To solve an equation such as $x^{2}-9=0$, we could proceed as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^{2}-9 & =0 \\
x^{2} & =9 \\
x & =\sqrt{9}= \pm 3
\end{aligned}
$$

However, if $x^{2}+9=0$

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^{2} & =-9 \\
x & =\sqrt{-9}
\end{aligned}
$$

and since no real number multiplied by itself gives -9 , no real number can satisfy this equation.
To deal with the square root of a negative number, a new number $\sqrt{-1}$ is created.
This number is called $\boldsymbol{i}$.

Hence, $\quad \sqrt{-9}=\sqrt{9 \times-1}=\sqrt{9} \times \sqrt{-1}= \pm 3 i$.
Similarly, $\sqrt{-16}=\sqrt{16 \times-1}=\sqrt{16} \times \sqrt{-1}= \pm 4 i$ and

$$
\sqrt{-5}=\sqrt{5 \times-1}=\sqrt{5} \times \sqrt{-1}= \pm \sqrt{5} i .
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
i & =\sqrt{-1} \\
\Rightarrow i^{2} & =-1
\end{aligned}
$$

Square roots of negative numbers are called imaginary numbers and are written in the form of $b i$, where $b$ is a real number, e.g. $3 i$.

## Example 1

Solve the equation $x^{2}+25=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^{2}+25 & =0 \\
x^{2} & =-25 \\
x & =\sqrt{-25}=\sqrt{25 \times-1}=\sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{-1} \\
x & = \pm 5 i
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

Solve the equation $x^{2}+2 x+2=0$.
Using the quadratic formula, we have $a=1, b=2, c=2$.
Hence, $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x=\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^{2}-4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} \\
& x=\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2}=\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 \times-1}}{2}=\frac{-2 \pm 2 i}{2} \\
& x=-1 \pm i
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, $x=-1+i,-1-i$.

Numbers such as $-1+i$ are called complex numbers and are normally denoted by the letter $\boldsymbol{z}$.
A complex number such as $z=3+6 i$, has two parts (dimensions); a real part and an imaginary part.

The first part of this complex number is the real constant 3.
The second part of this complex number is imaginary; the real constant 6 multiplied by $i$.
3 is referred to as the real part and is given by $\operatorname{Re}(z)=\mathbf{3}$.
6 is referred to as the imaginary part and is given by $\boldsymbol{\operatorname { I m }}(\boldsymbol{z})=\mathbf{6}$.
The set of complex numbers is denoted by $\mathbf{C}$.

Complex number ( $z$ ):

$$
\begin{aligned}
& z=x+i y \\
& \operatorname{Re}(z)=x \text { and } \operatorname{Im}(z)=y
\end{aligned}
$$

| Complex number $(z)$ | Real part, $\mathbf{R e}(z)$ | Imaginary part, Im(z) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $4+3 i$ | 4 | 3 |
| $3-i$ | 3 | -1 |
| -5 | -5 | 0 |
| $2 i$ | 0 | 2 |
| $3-\sqrt{5} i$ | 3 | $-\sqrt{5}$ |

## Adding and subtracting complex numbers

When adding or subtracting complex numbers, we add (or subtract) the real and imaginary parts separately.

For example: (i) $(4+3 i)+(3-2 i)=4+3 i+3-2 i$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =(4+3)+(3 i-2 i) \\
& =7+i
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $(3+7 i)-(4-5 i)=3+7 i-4+5 i$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =3-4+7 i+5 i \\
& =-1+12 i
\end{aligned}
$$

## Multiplying complex numbers

For example: (i)

$$
\text { i) } \begin{aligned}
(3+5 i)(4-3 i) & =3(4-3 i)+5 i(4-3 i) \\
& =12-9 i+20 i-15 i^{2} \\
& =12-9 i+20 i-15(-1) \\
& =12-9 i+20 i+15 \\
& =12+15-9 i+20 i \\
& =27+11 i
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $(2+4 i)(2-4 i)=2(2-4 i)+4 i(2-4 i)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =4-8 i+8 i-16 i^{2} \\
& =4-16(-1) \\
& =20
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

If $z_{1}=2+3 i, z_{2}=3-4 i$ and $z_{3}=1+5 i$, express each of the following complex numbers in the form $a+b i$.
(i) $z_{1}+z_{3}$
(ii) $z_{2} \cdot z_{3}$
(iii) $z_{1}\left(z_{2}+z_{3}\right)$
(i) $z_{1}+z_{3}=2+3 i+1+5 i$

$$
=2+1+3 i+5 i=3+8 i
$$

(ii) $z_{2} \cdot z_{3}=(3-4 i)(1+5 i)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =3+15 i-4 i-20 i^{2} \\
& =3+20+15 i-4 i=23+11 i
\end{aligned}
$$

(iii) $z_{1}\left(z_{2}+z_{3}\right)=(2+3 i)(3-4 i+1+5 i)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =(2+3 i)(4+i) \\
& =8+2 i+12 i+3 i^{2} \\
& =8-3+2 i+12 i \quad \ldots+3 i^{2}=-3 \\
& =5+14 i
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 1.3 Division and Equality of complex numbers

Complex numbers can be divided by a real number as follows.

$$
\frac{2+5 i}{2}=\frac{2}{2}+\frac{5}{2} i=1+\frac{5}{2} i
$$

To divide a complex number by another non-real complex number, we must change the denominator into a real number using a complex conjugate.

## Complex conjugate

Given any complex number $z=a+b i$, then the complex conjugate of $z$, written $\bar{z}$, is $a-b i$.
For example, if $z=3+4 i$,

$$
\text { then } \bar{z}=3-4 i, \text { where } \bar{z} \text { is the complex conjugate of } z .
$$

The product $z . \bar{z}=(3+4 i)(3-4 i)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =9-12 i+12 i-16 i^{2} \\
& =9+16 \\
& =25, \text { a real number }

Complex conjugate: If $z=a+b i$, then $\bar{z}=\mathrm{a}-i b$
Note:

| $\boldsymbol{z}$ | $\overline{\boldsymbol{z}}$ |
| ---: | ---: |
| $3+7 \boldsymbol{i}$ | $3-7 \boldsymbol{i}$ |
| $2-4 \boldsymbol{i}$ | $2+4 \boldsymbol{i}$ |
| $-3+\boldsymbol{i}$ | $-3-\boldsymbol{i}$ |
| $+4 \boldsymbol{i}$ | $-4 \boldsymbol{i}$ |

Using the complex conjugate, we can divide complex numbers as shown in the following example.

## Example 1

Write $\frac{3+4 i}{2-5 i}$ in the form $a+b i$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{3+4 i}{2-5 i} & =\frac{3+4 i}{2-5 i} \times \frac{2+5 i}{2+5 i} \\
& =\frac{6+15 i+8 i+20 i^{2}}{4+10 i-10 i-25 i^{2}} \\
& =\frac{6+23 i-20}{4+25} \quad \ldots \text { since } i^{2}=-1 \\
& =\frac{-14+23 i}{29}=-\frac{14}{29}+\frac{23 i}{29}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Equality of complex numbers

For two complex numbers to be equal, their real parts must be equal and their imaginary parts must be equal.

If $(x+2)+4 i=6+(y-2) i$,
then $x+2=6$ and $4=y-2$
$\Rightarrow x=4$ and $6=y$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { If } a+b i \quad=\quad x+y i \text {, } \\
& \text { then } a=x \quad \text { and } \quad b=y
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

Find $x$ and $y$ if $x+2 i+2(3-5 y i)=8-13 i$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x+2 i+2(3-5 y i)=8-13 i \\
\Rightarrow \quad & x+2 i+6-10 y i=8-13 i \\
\Rightarrow \quad & x+6+(2-10 y) i=8-13 i
\end{aligned}
$$

Equating the real parts:
Equating the imaginary parts:

$$
\begin{array}{r}
x+6=8 \\
x=2
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
2-10 y & =-13 \\
-10 y & =-15 \\
10 y & =15 \\
y & =\frac{15}{10}=\frac{3}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

Given that $(z+1)(2-i)=3-4 i$, find $z$ in the form $x+y i$, where $x, y \in R$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
(z+1)(2-i) & =3-4 i \\
\Rightarrow \quad z+1 & =\frac{3-4 i}{2-i} \times \frac{2+i}{2+i} \\
& =\frac{3-4 i}{2-i} \times \frac{2+i}{2+i}=\frac{6+3 i-8 i-4 i^{2}}{4+2 i-2 i-i^{2}} \\
& =\frac{10-5 i}{5} \\
z+1 & =2-i \\
\therefore \quad z & =2-i-1 \\
& =1-i
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 4

Express $\sqrt{5+12 i}$ in the form of $a+b i$, where $a, b \in R$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Let } \quad \begin{aligned}
a+b i & =\sqrt{5+12 i} \\
(a+b i)^{2} & =5+12 i \\
\Rightarrow a^{2}+2 a b i+b^{2} i^{2} & =5+12 i \\
\Rightarrow \quad a^{2}-b^{2}+2 a b i & =5+12 i
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad a^{2}-b^{2}=5 \quad \text { and } \quad 2 a b & =12 \\
\Rightarrow \quad a & =\frac{12}{2 b}=\frac{6}{b}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore & \left(\frac{6}{b}\right)^{2}-b^{2}=5 \\
& \quad 6^{2}-b^{4}=5 b^{2} \\
\Rightarrow \quad b^{4}+5 b^{2}-36=0 & \\
\left(b^{2}+9\right)\left(b^{2}-4\right)=0 \Rightarrow \quad b^{2} & =-9 \quad \text { or } \quad b^{2}=4 \\
& \\
& b=\sqrt{-9} \quad b= \pm 2 \\
& b= \pm 3 i
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $a=\frac{6}{b}$, when $b=+2, a=\frac{6}{2}=3$
[Note: $b \neq 3 i$ since $b \in R$ ]
when $b=-2, a=\frac{6}{-2}=-3$
$\therefore \sqrt{5+12 i}=(3+2 i)$ or $(-3-2 i)$

## Section 1.4 Argand diagram - Modulus

The Argand diagram gives a geometric representation of a complex number as a point in the complex plane.

Real numbers can be plotted on a single number line but complex numbers, with two parts consisting of a real part and an imaginary part, need a plane of points to represent them.

The complex plane is similar to the Cartesian plane, with the real part $\operatorname{Re}(z)$ of a complex number represented by the $x$-axis, and the imaginary part $\operatorname{Im}(z)$ represented by the $y$-axis.

In this diagram we have plotted the complex numbers
(i) $z_{1}=5+2 i$
(ii) $z_{2}=0+4 i=4 i$
(iii) $z_{3}=2+0 i=2$
(iv) $z_{4}=-2-4 i$
(v) $\bar{z}_{1}=5-2 i$

## Modulus of a complex number

The modulus of a complex number is the distance from the origin to the point in the plane representing the number.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-018.jpg?height=517&width=621&top_left_y=166&top_left_x=614)

The modulus of $z_{1}=3+4 i$ is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left|z_{1}\right| & =\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{25}=5
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the modulus of $z_{2}=-4-3 i$, is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left|z_{2}\right| & =\sqrt{(-4)^{2}+(-3)^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{16+9} \\
& =\sqrt{25}=5
\end{aligned}
$$

If $z=a+b i$, then the modulus of $z$, written as $|z|$, is given by

$$
|z|=\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}
$$

This shows that $3+4 i$ and $-4-3 i$ have equal moduli and hence lie on the circumference of the same circle (with centre at the origin).

## Example 1

Given that $z_{1}=4+i$ and $z_{2}=-2+2 i$, plot the following on an Argand diagram:

$$
0, z_{1}, z_{2} \text { and }\left(z_{1}+z_{2}\right) .
$$

Also calculate $\left|z_{1}\right|,\left|z_{2}\right|$ and $\left|z_{1}+z_{2}\right|$. Is $\left|z_{1}\right|+\left|z_{2}\right|=\left|z_{1}+z_{2}\right|$ ?

$$
\begin{aligned}
& z_{1}=4+i \Rightarrow\left|z_{1}\right|=\sqrt{4^{2}+1^{2}} \\
&=\sqrt{17} \\
& z_{2}=-2+2 i \Rightarrow \left\lvert\, \begin{aligned}
\left|z_{2}\right| & =\sqrt{(-2)^{2}+(2)^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{4+4} \\
& =\sqrt{8}
\end{aligned}\right.
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
z_{1}+z_{2}= & 4+i+(-2+2 i) & \Rightarrow & \left|z_{1}\right|+\left|z_{2}\right|=\sqrt{17}+\sqrt{8} \\
= & 2+3 i & & \left|z_{1}+z_{2}\right|=\sqrt{13} \\
\left|z_{1}+z_{2}\right| & =\sqrt{2^{2}+3^{2}} & \Rightarrow & \left|z_{1}\right|+\left|z_{2}\right| \neq\left|z_{1}+z_{2}\right| .
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 1.5 Transformations of complex numbers

## 1. Multiplying a complex number by a real number

If a complex number $z_{1}=3+2 i$ is multiplied by 4 , we get $4 z_{1}=4(3+2 i)=12+8 i$.
The real part is increased by a factor of 4 and the imaginary part is also increased by a factor of 4 .

The complex number appears to be stretched along a line from the origin by a factor of 4 . For example, $3+2 i$ is mapped onto $12+8 i$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-020.jpg?height=331&width=637&top_left_y=1916&top_left_x=1018)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-021.jpg?height=456&width=513&top_left_y=182&top_left_x=663)

If the complex number is multiplied by $\frac{1}{2}$, a contraction occurs.
For example, $(-5+6 i)$ is mapped onto $-2.5+3 i$.
Multiplying by ( -1 ) changes the direction, that is, the number is reflected through the origin. For example, $(3+i) \times(-1)$ is mapped onto $-3-i$.

If $z=x+i y$, then the transformation $a z$ has the following results:
(i) $|a|>1$, results in stretching away from the origin
(ii) $0<|a|<1$, results in a contraction towards the origin
(iii) a $<0$, then $a z$ is reflected in the origin and stretched or contracted as in (i) or (ii)

## 2. Adding complex numbers

(i) When a complex number $z$ is added separately to other complex numbers - $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}-$ it creates a translation of the plane.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Let } z=-2+3 i \\
& \text { and } z=3+2 i, z_{2}=1+4 i, z_{3}=2-2 i . \\
& \text { Then } z+z_{1}=-2+3 i+3+2 i=1+5 i \\
& z+z_{2}=-2+3 i+1+4 i=-1+7 i \\
& z+z_{3}=-2+3 i+2-2 i=i
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the complex number $z_{1}$ translates to $z_{1}+z$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-021.jpg?height=607&width=480&top_left_y=1285&top_left_x=1151)
(ii) When $z_{1}$ is added to $z_{2}$ to create the new complex number $\left(z_{1}+z_{2}\right)$, the three complex numbers form a parallelogram with the origin $(0+0 i)$.

Let $z_{1}=-2+2 i$ and $z_{2}=3+2 i$, then $z_{1}+z_{2}=-2+2 i+3+2 i$

$$
=1+4 i .
$$

$0+0 i,-2+2 i, 3+2 i$ and $1+4 i$ form a parallelogram, as shown.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-022.jpg?height=312&width=833&top_left_y=226&top_left_x=809)

## 3. Multiplying complex numbers

(i) When a complex number such as $4+i$ is multiplied by $i$, the complex number rotates anti-clockwise about the origin by a quarter of a turn.
For example, $(4+i) . i=4 i+i^{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
= & 4 i-1 \\
= & -1+4 i \\
& \ldots \text { a rotation of } 90^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

Also, $(4+i)\left(i^{2}\right)=(4+i)(i)(i)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
(-1+4 i)(i) & =-i+4 i^{2} \\
& =-i-4 \\
& =-4-i
\end{aligned}
$$

... a rotation of $180^{\circ}$
Note: $\quad(-4-i)(-i)=+4 i+i^{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =+4 i-1 \\
& =-1+4 i
\end{aligned}
$$

... a rotation of $-90^{\circ}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-022.jpg?height=510&width=585&top_left_y=634&top_left_x=1049)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& z \times i, z \text { rotates by } 90^{\circ} \\
& z \times(i)^{2}, z \text { rotates by } 180^{\circ} \\
& z \times(i)^{3}, z \text { rotates by } 270^{\circ} \\
& z \times(i)^{4}, z \text { rotates by } 360^{\circ} \\
& z \times(-i), z \text { rotates by }\left(-90^{\circ}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) When $z_{1}=2+i$ is multiplied by $z_{2}=3+i$, the product can be seen as a combination of a stretching and rotation transformation as follows.

$$
\begin{aligned}
z_{1} z_{2} & =(2+i)(3+i) \\
& =2(3+i)+i(3+i)
\end{aligned}
$$

$2(3+i)$ produces a stretching effect from $(3+i)$ to $6+2 i$.
$i(3+i)$ produces a rotation of $90^{\circ}$ from $(3+i)$ to $-1+3 i$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
2(3+i)+i(3+i) & =6+2 i+3 i-1 \\
& =5+5 i
\end{aligned}
$$

This combines both transformations.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-022.jpg?height=510&width=654&top_left_y=1612&top_left_x=974)

## Example 1

(i) Plot the complex numbers $z_{1}=3+2 i, z_{2}=3+3 i, z_{3}=4+2 i$ on the Argand diagram.
(ii) Using the same axes, plot the complex numbers $3 z_{1}, 3 z_{2}$ and $3 z_{3}$.
(iii) Plot the rotation $z_{1}(i)^{2}, z_{2}(i)^{2}$ and $z_{3}(i)^{2}$.
(iv) The complex numbers $4-i, 4,5-i$ are the images of $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}$ by the translation $a+b i$. Find the values of $a$ and $b$.
(i)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-023.jpg?height=720&width=1050&top_left_y=649&top_left_x=366)
(ii) If $z_{1}=3+2 i, 3 z_{1}=9+6 i$

If $z_{2}=3+3 i, 3 z_{2}=9+9 i$
If $z_{3}=4+2 i, 3 z_{3}=12+6 i$
(iii) $z_{1}(i)^{2}=(3+2 i)(-1)=-3-2 i$
$z_{2}(i)^{2}=(3+3 i)(-1)=-3-3 i$
$z_{3}(i)^{2}=(4+2 i)(-1)=-4-2 i$
(iv) $z_{1}+a+b i=4-i$

$$
\begin{aligned}
a+b i & =4-i-z_{1} \\
a+b i & =4-i-(3+2 i) \\
& =1-3 i \\
\Rightarrow \quad a & =1, b=-3
\end{aligned}
$$

[Checking $z_{3}: 4+2 i+(1-3 i)=5-i \ldots$ which is correct.]

## Example 2

Describe the transformation in each of the following:
(i) $z_{1}, z_{2} \longrightarrow z_{3}, z_{4}$
(ii) $z_{1}, z_{2} \longrightarrow z_{5}, z_{6}$

Solution:
(i) $z_{1}, z_{2} \longrightarrow z_{3}, z_{4}$
a contraction by $\frac{1}{2}$
$\therefore \quad z_{3}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) z_{1}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-024.jpg?height=409&width=584&top_left_y=272&top_left_x=948)
(ii) $z_{1}, z_{2} \longrightarrow z_{5}, z_{6}$
a rotation clockwise by $90^{\circ}$
$\therefore \quad z_{5}=(-i) z_{1}$

## Exercise 1.5

1. Plot the complex numbers $z_{1}=1+i, z_{2}=3+2 i, z_{3}=4-i$ on an Argand diagram.

## Section 1.6 Conjugate roots theorem

When dealing with complex numbers, it is usual to use $z$ instead of $x$ as a variable.
The quadratic equation then takes the form $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{z}^{\mathbf{2}}+\boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{z}+\boldsymbol{c}=\mathbf{0}$.
Consider the quadratic equation $z^{2}+2 z+2=0$.
Using the quadratic formula where $a=1, b=2$ and $c=2$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow z & =\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \\
& =\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^{2}-4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} \\
& =\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2}=\frac{-2 \pm 2 i}{2}=-1 \pm i
\end{aligned}
$$

The roots of this equation are $z_{1}=-1+i$ and $z_{2}=-1-i$ which we note are the complex conjugates of each other.

The sum of the roots $=(-1+i)+(-1-i)=-2($ a real number $)$.
The product of the roots $=(-1+i)(-1-i)=1+i-i-i^{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =1+1 \\
& =2(\text { a real number }) .
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad z^{2}-($ Sum of roots $) z+($ Product of roots $)=z^{2}-(-2) z+2=0$

$$
=z^{2}+2 z+2=0 .
$$

Therefore, the roots of a quadratic equation with real coefficients occur in conjugate pairs.

## Example 1

If $z=1+5 i$ is a root of the equation $a z^{2}+b z+c=0$, where $a, b, c \in R$, find a possible set of values for values of $a, b, c$.

Given $1+5 i$ is one root and since the coefficients are real, therefore the roots occur in conjugate pairs; the other root is $1-5 i$.
$\therefore$ the two roots are $1+5 i$ and $1-5 i$
$\therefore \quad z^{2}-$ (Sum of roots) $z+$ Product of roots $=0$
$\Rightarrow z^{2}-(1+5 i+1-5 i) z+(1+5 i)(1-5 i)=0$
$\Rightarrow z^{2}-2 z+1-\not z i+\not z i-25 i^{2}=0$
$z^{2}-2 z+26=0$
$\therefore \quad a=1, b=-2$ and $c=26$

## Example 2

Given that $z=2+i$ is a root of $z^{2}-4 z+5=0$, show that $\bar{z}$ is also a root.
$z=2+i \Rightarrow \bar{z}=2-i$
Since $f(z)=z^{2}-4 z+5=0$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow f(2-i) & =(2-i)^{2}-4(2-i)+5 \\
& =4-\not A i+i^{2}-8+4 i+5 \\
& =4-1-8+5=0
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad 2-i$ is also a root of $z^{2}-4 z+5=0$.

We can now generalise this result to include all polynomials with real coefficients and state the conjugate roots theorem as follows:

## Conjugate roots theorem

If $z$ is a root of $a z^{n}+b z^{n-1}+\ldots . d z+c=0$ where $a, b, c, d, \ldots$. are all $\in R$, then $\bar{z}$ is also a root of this equation.

## Example 3

Given that $z=1+2 i$ is a root of $z^{3}-z^{2}+3 z+5=0$, show that $\bar{z}$ is also a root. Hence find the third root.

Since the coefficients are real, $z=1+2 i$ is a root

$$
\Rightarrow \bar{z}=1-2 i \text { is also a root. }
$$

Proof: $f(z)=z^{3}-z^{2}-3 z+5$

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(1-2 i) & =(1-2 i)^{3}-(1-2 i)^{2}+3(1-2 i)+5 \\
& =-11+2 i-(-3-4 i)+3-6 i+5 \\
& =-\not y+\not 2 i+\not 2+\not a i+\not 2-\not b i+\not 2 \\
& =0
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad 1-2 i$ is also a root.
If $1+2 i$ and $1-2 i$ are roots $\Rightarrow z^{2}-(1+2 i+1-2 i) z+(1+2 i)(1-2 i)=0$

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Rightarrow z^{2}-2 z+5=0 \text { is a quadratic equation formed } \\
\text { from two of the roots. }
\end{gathered}
$$

$\therefore$ The third factor can be obtained by dividing the cubic expression by the quadratic expression.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left.z^{2}-2 z+5\right) \overline{z^{3}-z^{2}+3 z+5} \\
& \frac{z^{3}-2 z^{2}+5 z}{z^{2}-2 z+5} \\
& \frac{z^{2}-2 z+5}{0} \\
& \therefore \quad z+1=0 \\
& \text { and } z=-1 \text { is the third root. }
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { or } & (z+a)\left(z^{2}-2 z+5\right) \\
& \equiv z^{3}-z^{2}+3 z+5 \\
\Rightarrow \quad & 5 a \equiv 5 \ldots \text { equating coefficients } \\
& a=1 \\
\therefore \quad & (z+1) \text { is the third factor } \\
\therefore \quad & (z+1)=0 \\
& \text { and } z=-1 \text { is the third root. }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 1.7 Polar form of a complex number

By studying this diagram, we can see that there are two ways to locate a point in the complex plane.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-029.jpg?height=305&width=567&top_left_y=1064&top_left_x=636)
(i) Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ or (ii) Polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sin \theta=\frac{y}{r} \Rightarrow y=r \sin \theta \\
& \cos \theta=\frac{x}{r} \Rightarrow x=r \cos \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, any complex number $x+y i$ can be written as $r \cos \theta+r i \sin \theta$.

$$
\Rightarrow \quad x+i y=r(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)
$$

We note also from the diagram that
(i) $r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=$ modulus of the number
(ii) $\tan \theta=\frac{y}{x}$
$\theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right), 0 \leq \theta<90^{\circ}$, where $\theta$ is called the argument of the number.

Rectangular form / Cartesian form: $\quad x+i y$
Polar form / Modulus argument form: $r(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)$

## Example 1

Express in the form $x+i y$ these complex numbers:
(a) $z_{1}=12\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{6}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$
(b) $z_{2}=5\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{8}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{8}\right)$
(a) $\cos \frac{\pi}{6}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\sin \frac{\pi}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$
... (Formulae and Tables, p. 13)

$$
\begin{aligned}
z_{1} & =12\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{6}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{6}\right) \\
& =12\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+i \frac{1}{2}\right) \\
& =6 \sqrt{3}+6 i
\end{aligned}
$$

1. The argument of a complex number can be given in degrees or radians.
$180^{\circ}=\pi(3.1415 \ldots$.$) radians$
2. When using $\pi$ use the rad mode on the calculator.
(b) $\sin \frac{\pi}{8}=0.382$ and $\cos \frac{\pi}{8}=0.924$

$$
\begin{aligned}
z_{2} & =5\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{8}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{8}\right) \\
& =5[0.924+i(0.382)] \\
& =4.62+1.92 i
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

Express $(-1+i \sqrt{3})$ in the form $r(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-030.jpg?height=482&width=496&top_left_y=1258&top_left_x=662)
$r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=\sqrt{(-1)^{2}+(\sqrt{3})^{2}}=\sqrt{4}=2$
$\theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{-1}\right)=-\frac{\pi}{3}$ or $+\frac{2 \pi}{3}$
[Note: $\tan \left(-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)=\tan \left(\pi-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)=\tan \left(\frac{2 \pi}{3}\right)=-1.7321$ ]
By plotting the complex number, we see that the argument required is $\frac{2 \pi}{3}$.
$\therefore r(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)=2\left(\cos \frac{2 \pi}{3}+i \sin \frac{2 \pi}{3}\right)$.

Note 1: When calculating the argument of a complex number, the principal value of $\theta$ is taken to be between $-\pi$ and $+\pi$, that $-\pi<\theta \leq \pi$.

Note 2: When using a calculator to find the argument $(\theta)$, it is important to check that the angle given by the calculator locates the correct quadrant for the particular complex number.

By first plotting the complex number on an Argand diagram, it can help to solve this problem.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-031.jpg?height=404&width=524&top_left_y=741&top_left_x=370)

The tan ratio is negative in both 2nd and 4th quadrants.

The tan ratio is positive in both the 1st and 3rd quadrants.

## Example 3

Write the complex number $1-i \sqrt{3}$ in modulus/argument form.

$$
x+i y=1-i \sqrt{3}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Modulus } r & =\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{1^{2}+(-\sqrt{3})^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{4}=2 \\
\text { Argument } \theta & =\tan ^{-1} \frac{y}{x} \\
& =\tan ^{-1} \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{1} \\
& =\frac{-\pi}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-031.jpg?height=409&width=465&top_left_y=1474&top_left_x=1069)

Since the complex number is in the 4 th quadrant, $\frac{-\pi}{3}$ is the correct argument.

$$
\begin{array}{lrl}
\Rightarrow & (r, \theta) & =\left(2, \frac{-\pi}{3}\right) \\
\therefore & 1-i \sqrt{3} & =\left[2 \cos \left(\frac{-\pi}{3}\right)+i \sin \left(\frac{-\pi}{3}\right)\right]
\end{array}
$$

## Example 4

Write $-\sqrt{3}-i$ in polar form.

$$
x+i y=-\sqrt{3}-i
$$

Modulus $r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\sqrt{(-\sqrt{3})^{2}+(-1)^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{3+1}=2
\end{aligned}
$$

Argument $\theta=\tan ^{-1} \frac{y}{x}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-032.jpg?height=426&width=573&top_left_y=315&top_left_x=963)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{-1}{-\sqrt{3}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\
& =\frac{\pi}{6}\left(30^{\circ}\right) \ldots \ldots \\
\Rightarrow \quad \theta & =\frac{-5 \pi}{6}\left(-150^{\circ}\right) \\
\therefore \quad-\sqrt{3}-i & =2\left[\cos \left(\frac{-5 \pi}{6}\right)+i \sin \left(\frac{-5 \pi}{6}\right)\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 1.8 Products and quotients of complex numbers in polar form

Consider the complex numbers $z_{1}=r_{1}\left(\cos \theta_{1}+i \sin \theta_{1}\right)$ and $z_{2}=r_{2}\left(\cos \theta_{2}+i \sin \theta_{2}\right)$.
Then $z_{1} \cdot z_{2}=r_{1}\left(\cos \theta_{1}+i \sin \theta_{1}\right) \cdot r_{2}\left(\cos \theta_{2}+i \sin \theta_{2}\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =r_{1} r_{2}\left[\cos \theta_{1} \cos \theta_{2}+i \cos \theta_{1} \sin \theta_{2}+i \sin \theta_{1} \cos \theta_{2}+i^{2} \sin \theta_{1} \sin \theta_{2}\right] \\

$$

$\Rightarrow$ Modulus of $z_{1} \cdot z_{2}=r_{1} \cdot r_{2}$ and argument of $z_{1} \cdot z_{2}=\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}$
Also, $\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}=\frac{r_{1}\left(\cos \theta_{1}+i \sin \theta_{1}\right)}{r_{2}\left(\cos \theta_{2}+i \sin \theta_{2}\right)}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{r_{1}\left(\cos \theta_{1}+i \sin \theta_{1}\right)}{r_{2}\left(\cos \theta_{2}+i \sin \theta_{2}\right)} \times \frac{\left(\cos \theta_{2}-i \sin \theta_{2}\right)}{\left(\cos \theta_{2}-i \sin \theta_{2}\right)} \\
& =\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}} \frac{\left[\cos \theta_{1} \cos \theta_{2}-i \cos \theta_{1} \sin \theta_{2}+i \sin \theta_{1} \cos \theta_{2}-i^{2} \sin \theta_{1} \sin \theta_{2}\right]}{\left[\cos ^{2} \theta_{2}-i \cos \theta_{2} \sin \theta_{2}+i \sin \theta_{2} \cos \theta_{2}-i^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta_{2}\right]} \\
& =\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}\left[\frac{\cos \theta_{1} \cos \theta_{2}+\sin \theta_{1} \sin \theta_{2}+i\left(\sin \theta_{1} \cos \theta_{2}-\cos \theta_{1} \sin \theta_{2}\right)}{\cos ^{2} \theta_{2}+\sin ^{2} \theta_{2}}\right] \\
& =\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}\left[\frac{\cos \left(\theta_{1}-\theta_{2}\right)+i \sin \left(\theta_{1}-\theta_{2}\right)}{1}\right] \quad \ldots \text { (Formulae and Tables, p. 15) }

$\Rightarrow$ Modulus of $\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}=\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}$ and the argument of $\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}=\theta_{1}-\theta_{2}$.
If $\quad z_{1}=r_{1}\left(\cos \theta_{1}+i \sin \theta_{1}\right)$
and $\quad z_{2}=r_{2}\left(\cos \theta_{2}+i \sin \theta_{2}\right)$,

## Section 1.9 De Moivre's theorem

In the previous section, we saw that

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta) & =\cos (\theta+\theta)+i \sin (\theta+\theta) \\
& =\cos 2 \theta+i \sin 2 \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

That is

$$
(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{2}=\cos 2 \theta+i \sin 2 \theta
$$

Also

$$
(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{3}=\cos 3 \theta+i \sin 3 \theta
$$

The general case of this result is known as de Moivre's theorem.
De Moivre's theorem

$$
\begin{aligned}
& (\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{n} \equiv \cos n \theta+i \sin n \theta \\
& \quad \text { for all real values of } n
\end{aligned}
$$

## Proof of de Moivre's Theorem by Induction

When $n$ is a positive integer, prove $(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{n}=(\cos n \theta+i \sin n \theta)$
(i) Let $n=1 \Rightarrow(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{1}=\cos \theta+i \sin \theta \ldots$ which is true
(ii) Assume that $(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{k}=\cos k \theta+i \sin k \theta$
(iii) Prove true for $n=k+1$, i.e.,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \begin{aligned}
(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{k+1}= & {[\cos (k+1) \theta+i \sin (k+1) \theta] }
\end{aligned} \\
& \text { Proof: } \quad(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{k+1}=(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{k}(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta) \\
& =(\cos k \theta+i \sin k \theta)(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta) \ldots \text { assumed } \\
& =\cos k \theta \cos \theta+i \cos k \theta \sin \theta+i \sin k \theta \cos \theta-\sin k \theta \sin \theta \\
& =\cos k \theta \cos \theta-\sin k \theta \sin \theta+i(\cos k \theta \sin \theta+\sin k \theta \cos \theta) \\
& =\cos (k+1) \theta+i \sin (k+1) \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, if it is true for $n=k$, it is true for $n=k+1$.
But it is true for $n=1$.
Thus, it is true for $n=1+1=2$.
Therefore, the theorem is true for $n=1,2,3, \ldots$. i.e. $n \in N$.

If $z=r(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)$, then using de Moivre's Theorem:

$$
\begin{aligned}
z^{n} & =[r(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)]^{n} \\
& =r^{n}(\cos n \theta+i \sin n \theta) \text { for all } n \in N
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 1

Find the value of $\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{6}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{6}\right)^{3}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{6}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{6}\right)^{3} & =\cos \frac{3 \pi}{6}+i \sin \frac{3 \pi}{6} \\
& =\cos \frac{\pi}{2}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{2} \\
& =0+i=i
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

Write $1+\sqrt{3} i$ in polar form and hence find the value of $(1+\sqrt{3} i)^{9}$.

$$
x+i y=1+\sqrt{3} i
$$

Modulus $r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=\sqrt{1^{2}+(\sqrt{3})^{2}}=2$
Argument $\theta=\tan ^{-1} \frac{y}{x}=\tan ^{-1} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{1}=\frac{\pi}{3}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad z=1+\sqrt{3} i=2\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{3}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{3}\right) \\
& \therefore \quad z^{9}=(1+\sqrt{3} i)^{9}=2^{9}\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{3}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{3}\right)^{9} \\
& =2^{9}\left(\cos \frac{9 \pi}{3}+i \sin \frac{9 \pi}{3}\right) \\
& =2^{9}(\cos 3 \pi+i \sin 3 \pi) \\
& =2^{9}(-1+i .0) \\
& =-2^{9}=-512
\end{aligned}
$$

## Exercise 1.9

1. Use de Moivre's theorem to simplify each of the following, expressing your answers in the form $a+b i$ :
(i) $\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)+i \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)\right)^{4}$
(ii) $\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)+i \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)\right)^{7}$

(vii) $\left(\cos \frac{-\pi}{18}+i \sin \frac{-\pi}{18}\right)^{9}$
(viii) $\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{6}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{6}\right)^{-3}$
2. Given $z=\sqrt{2}\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{3}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{3}\right)$, express $z^{4}$ in the form $a+b i$.
3. Given $z=3\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{10}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{10}\right)$, express $z^{5}$ in the form $a+b i$.

Hence express $\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{3}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{3}\right)^{2}\left(\cos \frac{2 \pi}{3}+i \sin \frac{2 \pi}{3}\right)^{4}$ in the form $a+b i$.

(v) $z_{1} \cdot z_{2}$
(vi) $\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}$

(ii) $(1+\sqrt{3} i)^{3}$
(iii) $(-2-2 i)^{4}$
7. Find the value of $(1+i)^{4}$.
8. Express 4-4i in polar form.

Hence find the value of $\frac{1}{(4-4 i)^{3}}$.
9. Simplify
(i) $(3-\sqrt{3} i)^{6}$
(ii) $(2+2 \sqrt{3} i)^{6}$.
10. Express $\frac{\sqrt{3}+i}{1+\sqrt{3} i}$ in the form $r(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)$.

Hence evaluate $\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}+i}{1+\sqrt{3} i}\right)^{6}$.

## Section 1.10 Applications of de Moivre's Theorem

## Simplifying expressions of the form $(\boldsymbol{\operatorname { c o s }} \boldsymbol{\theta}-\boldsymbol{i} \boldsymbol{\operatorname { s i n }} \boldsymbol{\theta})^{\boldsymbol{n}}$

de Moivre's theorem applies to ( $\cos \theta+i \sin \theta$ ) and not to ( $\cos \theta-i \sin \theta$ ).
However, since $-\sin \theta=\sin (-\theta)$ and $\cos \theta=\cos (-\theta)$,
then

$$
\cos \theta-i \sin \theta=\cos (-\theta)+i \sin (-\theta) .
$$

Hence, $(\cos \theta-i \sin \theta)^{n}=[\cos (-\theta)+i \sin (-\theta)]^{n}$

$$
=[\cos (-n \theta)+i \sin (-n \theta)]
$$

## Example 1

Simplify $\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{3}-i \sin \frac{\pi}{3}\right)^{6}$, giving your answer in rectangular form $(x+i y)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos \frac{\pi}{3}-i \sin \frac{\pi}{3} & =\cos \left(-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)+i \sin \left(-\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \\
\Rightarrow \quad\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{3}-i \sin \frac{\pi}{3}\right)^{6} & =\left(\cos \left(-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)+i \sin \left(-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right)^{6} \\
& =\cos \left(-\frac{6 \pi}{3}\right)+i \sin \left(-\frac{6 \pi}{3}\right) \\
& =\cos (-2 \pi)+i \sin (-2 \pi) \\
& =1+i .0 \\
& =1
\end{aligned}
$$

## Expressing $\cos n \theta$ and $\sin n \theta$ in terms of $\cos \theta$ and $\sin \theta$

## Example 2

Express (a) $\cos 2 \theta$ in terms of $\cos \theta \quad$ (b) $\sin 3 \theta$ in terms of $\sin \theta$.
(a) $\quad \cos 2 \theta: \quad(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{2}=\cos 2 \theta+i \sin 2 \theta$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad \cos 2 \theta+i \sin 2 \theta & =(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{2} \\
& =\cos ^{2} \theta+2 i \cos \theta \sin \theta+i^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta \\
\cos 2 \theta+i \sin 2 \theta & =\cos ^{2} \theta-\sin ^{2} \theta+i(2 \cos \theta \sin \theta)
\end{aligned}
$$

Equating real parts: $\cos 2 \theta=\cos ^{2} \theta-\sin ^{2} \theta$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\cos ^{2} \theta-\left[1-\cos ^{2} \theta\right] \quad \ldots\left[\sin ^{2} \theta+\cos ^{2} \theta=1\right] \\
\cos 2 \theta & =2 \cos ^{2} \theta-1
\end{aligned}
$$

(Note: If we need $\sin 2 \theta$, we equate the imaginary parts.)
(b) $\sin 3 \theta: \quad(\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{3}=\cos 3 \theta+i \sin 3 \theta$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad \cos 3 \theta+i \sin 3 \theta= & (\cos \theta+i \sin \theta)^{3} \\
= & \cos ^{3} \theta+3 i \cos ^{2} \theta \sin \theta \\
& \quad+3 i^{2} \cos \theta \sin ^{2} \theta+i^{3} \sin ^{3} \theta \\
& \quad \ldots \quad \text { (using a Binomial expansion) } \\
= & \cos ^{3} \theta-3 \cos \theta \sin ^{2} \theta \\
& \quad+i\left(3 \cos ^{2} \theta \sin \theta-\sin ^{3} \theta\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Equating imaginary parts:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin 3 \theta & =3 \cos ^{2} \theta \sin \theta-\sin ^{3} \theta \\
& =3\left[1-\sin ^{2} \theta\right] \sin \theta-\sin ^{3} \theta \ldots\left[\cos ^{2} \theta=1-\sin ^{2} \theta\right] \\
& =3 \sin \theta-3 \sin ^{3} \theta-\sin ^{3} \theta \\
\sin 3 \theta & =3 \sin \theta-4 \sin ^{3} \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

## How to find the $\boldsymbol{n}$ th root of a complex number

If $z^{n}=a+b i \Rightarrow z=(a+b i)^{\frac{1}{n}}$, the $n$th root of $a+b i$.
Then
(i) $z^{3}=1+i \Rightarrow z=(1+i)^{\frac{1}{3}}$, the cube root of $(1+i)$
(ii) $z^{4}=0+8 i \Rightarrow z=(0+8 i)^{\frac{1}{4}}$, the fourth root of $8 i$.

To use de Moivre's theorem to find the $n$th root of a complex number, we need to express the complex number in general polar form.

Because the trigonometric functions cosine and sine are periodic functions, with period $2 \pi$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \cos \theta=\cos (\theta+2 n \pi) \text { and } \\
& \sin \theta=\sin (\theta+2 n \pi) \text { for } n \in Z .
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore a+b i=r[\cos (\theta+2 n \pi)+i \sin (\theta+2 n \pi)]$.

Given $z=a+b i$,
then $z=r[\cos (\theta+2 n \pi)+i \sin (\theta+2 n \pi)]$
where $n \in Z$ is the general polar form of $z$.

## Example 3

Solve the equation $z^{3}=8 i$.

$$
z^{3}=8 i \Rightarrow z=(8 i)^{\frac{1}{3}}
$$

Modulus $r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$

$$
=\sqrt{0^{2}+8^{2}}=8
$$

Argument $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$
$\therefore \quad 0+8 i=8\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{2}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{2}\right)$
... in polar form.

$$
8 i=8\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2}+2 n \pi\right)+i \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2}+2 n \pi\right)\right)
$$

... in general polar form.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad z & =(8 i)^{\frac{1}{3}}=8^{\frac{1}{3}}\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2}+2 n \pi\right)+i \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2}+2 n \pi\right)\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \\
& =2\left(\cos \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+2 n \pi\right)+i \sin \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+2 n \pi\right)\right) \quad \ldots \text { using de Moivre's theorem }
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $n=0: z=2\left(\cos \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)+i \sin \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\right)=2\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{6}+i \sin \frac{\pi}{6}\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =2\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+i \frac{1}{2}\right) \\
& =\sqrt{3}+i
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $n=1: \quad z=2\left(\cos \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+2 \pi\right)+i \sin \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+2 \pi\right)\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =2\left(\cos \left(\frac{5 \pi}{6}\right)+i \sin \left(\frac{5 \pi}{6}\right)\right) \\
& =2\left(\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}+i \frac{1}{2}\right) \\
& =-\sqrt{3}+i
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $n=2: z=2\left(\cos \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+4 \pi\right)+i \sin \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}+4 \pi\right)\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =2\left(\cos \frac{9 \pi}{6}+i \sin \frac{9 \pi}{6}\right) \\
& =2\left(\cos \frac{3 \pi}{2}+i \sin \frac{3 \pi}{2}\right) \\
& =2(0+i(-1)) \\
& =-2 i
\end{aligned}
$$

The cube roots of $8 i$ are

$$
\sqrt{3}+i, \quad-\sqrt{3}+i, \quad-2 i .
$$

## Example 4

Solve the equation $z^{2}=-2-2 \sqrt{3} i$.

$$
z^{2}=-2-2 \sqrt{3} i \Rightarrow z=(-2-2 \sqrt{3} i)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$

Modulus $r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$

$$
=\sqrt{(-2)^{2}+(-2 \sqrt{3})^{2}}=4
$$

$$
\text { Argument } \begin{aligned}
\theta & =\tan ^{-1} \frac{y}{x} \\
& =\tan ^{-1} \frac{-2 \sqrt{3}}{-2}=\tan ^{-1} \sqrt{3}=\frac{\pi}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

Tan $\theta$ is positive in the first and third quadrants.

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Rightarrow \quad \theta=-\frac{2 \pi}{3} \\
-2-2 \sqrt{3} i=4\left(\cos \left(-\frac{2 \pi}{3}\right)+i \sin \left(-\frac{2 \pi}{3}\right)\right) \\
z=(-2-2 \sqrt{3} i)^{\frac{1}{2}}=4^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\cos \left(-\frac{2 \pi}{3}+2 n \pi\right)+i \sin \left(-\frac{2 \pi}{3}+2 n \pi\right)\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
=2\left(\cos \frac{1}{2}\left(-\frac{2 \pi}{3}+2 n \pi\right)+i \sin \frac{1}{2}\left(-\frac{2 \pi}{3}+2 n \pi\right)\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

Let $n=0: \quad z=2\left(\cos \frac{1}{2}\left(-\frac{2 \pi}{3}\right)+i \sin \frac{1}{2}\left(-\frac{2 \pi}{3}\right)\right)$

$$
=2\left(\cos \left(-\frac{2 \pi}{6}\right)+i \sin \left(-\frac{2 \pi}{6}\right)\right)=2\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)=1-\sqrt{3} i
$$

Let $n=1: \quad z=2\left(\cos \frac{1}{2}\left(-\frac{2 \pi}{3}+2 \pi\right)+i \sin \frac{1}{2}\left(-\frac{2 \pi}{3}+2 \pi\right)\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =2\left(\cos \left(\frac{2 \pi}{3}\right)+i \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi}{3}\right)\right)=2\left(-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)=-1+\sqrt{3} i \\
\therefore \quad z & =1-\sqrt{3} i,-1+\sqrt{3} i

## Section 2.1 Enlargements

In this diagram the rectangle $\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime} \mathrm{D}^{\prime}$ is an enlargement of the rectangle ABCD .
Here

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
|\mathrm{AB}|=3 & \text { and }\left|\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime}\right|=9 \\
|\mathrm{AD}|=2 & \text { and }\left|\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{D}^{\prime}\right|=6
\end{array}
$$

The sides of the rectangle $\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime} \mathrm{D}^{\prime}$ are three times as long as the sides of the rectangle ABCD .
Here the scale factor is $\mathbf{3}$.

| D | C | $\mathrm{D}^{\prime}$ |  |  |  |  |  | $\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| A | B |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | $\mathrm{A}^{\prime}$ |  |  |  |  |  | $\mathrm{B}^{\prime}$ |

Now consider the two triangles ABC and $\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}$, shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-047.jpg?height=453&width=1271&top_left_y=1511&top_left_x=284)

The triangle $\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ is an enlargement of the triangle ABC .
The point $O$ is called the centre of enlargement.
Since $\left|\mathrm{OA}^{\prime}\right|=2|\mathrm{OA}|$, the scale factor is 2 .
Since the scale factor is $2, \quad\left|\mathrm{~A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime}\right|=2|\mathrm{AB}|, \quad\left|\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}\right|=2|\mathrm{AC}|$ and $\left|\mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}\right|=2|\mathrm{BC}|$.

The given triangle ABC is called the object.
The triangle $\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ is called the image.
The dotted lines are called guidelines or rays.

## Drawing enlargements

To construct the image of a given figure under an enlargement, we need
(i) the centre of enlargement
(ii) the scale factor of the enlargement.

The diagram on the right shows a square ABCD and a centre of enlargement O .

We will now enlarge $A B C D$ with $O$ as centre of enlargement and scale factor 3.

To find the image of A , we join O to A and continue to $\mathrm{A}^{\prime}$ so that $\left|\mathrm{OA}^{\prime}\right|=3|\mathrm{OA}|$.

Similarly, join O to B and continue to $\mathrm{B}^{\prime}$ so that $\left|\mathrm{OB}^{\prime}\right|=3|\mathrm{OB}|$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-048.jpg?height=373&width=663&top_left_y=636&top_left_x=965)

Repeat the process for the points C and D .
The square $\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime} \mathrm{D}^{\prime}$ is the image of the square ABCD .
Since the scale factor is $3,\left|\mathrm{~A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime}\right|=3|\mathrm{AB}|$ and $\left|\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{D}^{\prime}\right|=3|\mathrm{AD}|$.

## When a vertex is the centre of enlargement

The diagrams below show how to enlarge the shape ABCD by a scale factor of 2 using A as the centre of enlargement.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-048.jpg?height=376&width=1085&top_left_y=1406&top_left_x=376)

Notice that the centre of enlargement, A , does not move.
In the final figure, $\left|\mathrm{AB}^{\prime}\right|=2|\mathrm{AB}|,\left|\mathrm{AD}^{\prime}\right|=2|\mathrm{AD}|$ and $\left|\mathrm{AC}^{\prime}\right|=2|\mathrm{AC}|$.
The diagram on the right shows an enlargement where the centre of enlargement, X , is inside the figure.

In this enlargement, the scale factor is 2.
Draw the line $[\mathrm{XA}]$ and extend it so that $\left|\mathrm{XA}^{\prime}\right|=2|\mathrm{XA}|$.
Extend $[\mathrm{XB}]$ so that $\left|\mathrm{XB}^{\prime}\right|=2|\mathrm{XB}|$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-048.jpg?height=258&width=536&top_left_y=1964&top_left_x=1095)

Repeat for [XC].
Each side of the enlarged triangle $\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ is twice the length of the corresponding side in ABC .
For any enlargement, the scale factor is found by dividing the length of the image side by the length of the corresponding object side.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { The scale factor is } \\
& \frac{\text { length of image side }}{\text { length of corresponding object side }}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Enlargements with a Scale Factor less than 1

An enlargement with a scale factor less than 1 produces a smaller figure nearer to the centre of enlargement.

In the figure below, where $\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ is the image of ABC under an enlargement, the scale factor is $\frac{1}{2}$.
Thus $\left|\mathrm{OA}^{\prime}\right|=\frac{1}{2}|\mathrm{OA}|$ and $\left|\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{B}^{\prime}\right|=\frac{1}{2}|\mathrm{AB}|$.
If the scale factor is $k$, then
(i) if $k>1$, the figure is enlarged
(ii) if $k<1$, the figure is reduced.

When the scale factor is a positive fraction less than 1 , the result is a reduction of the given figure.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-049.jpg?height=446&width=861&top_left_y=819&top_left_x=772)

## Finding the centre of enlargement

When a figure and its enlargement are given, then the centre of enlargement is found by joining two sets of corresponding points and continuing the lines until they meet.

In the diagram on the right, $\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{C}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}$ meet at O .
The centre of enlargement is this point, O .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-049.jpg?height=437&width=866&top_left_y=1592&top_left_x=486)

## Example 1

In the given figure, $\mathrm{AB}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ is an enlargement of the triangle ABC where A is the centre of enlargement.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-050.jpg?height=350&width=513&top_left_y=353&top_left_x=658)

If $|\mathrm{AC}|=6,\left|\mathrm{CC}^{\prime}\right|=9$ and $\left|\mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}\right|=12.5$, find
(i) the scale factor of the enlargement
(ii) $|\mathrm{BC}|$
(iii) the ratio $|\mathrm{AB}|:\left|\mathrm{AB}^{\prime}\right|$.
(i) It may simplify your work if you draw the two triangles separately.

The scale factor $=\frac{\text { image length }}{\text { object length }}$

$$
=\frac{\left|\mathrm{AC}^{\prime}\right|}{|\mathrm{AC}|}=\frac{15}{6}=2.5
$$

(ii) Since the scale factor is $2 \frac{1}{2},\left|\mathrm{~B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}\right|=2 \frac{1}{2}|\mathrm{BC}|$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left|\mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}\right| \\
\therefore & 2 \frac{1}{2}|\mathrm{BC}| \Rightarrow|\mathrm{BC}|=\frac{\left|\mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}\right|}{2 \frac{1}{2}}=\frac{12.5}{2.5}=5 \\
\therefore \quad|\mathrm{BC}| & =5
\end{aligned}
$$

(iii) $\left|\mathrm{AB}^{\prime}\right|=2 \frac{1}{2}|\mathrm{AB}|$

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
\therefore & \frac{\left|A B^{\prime}\right|}{|A B|} & =2 \frac{1}{2}=\frac{5}{2} \\
\therefore & & \left|A B^{\prime}\right|:|A B| & =5: 2 \\
\Rightarrow & & |A B|:\left|A B^{\prime}\right| & =2: 5
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{x}{y}=\frac{3}{4} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad x: y=3: 4
\end{aligned}
$$

## Enlargement and area

The rectangle on the right is an enlargement of the rectangle on the left. The scale factor of the enlargement is $k$.

The area of the enlarged figure is $\boldsymbol{k}^{2}$ (area)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-050.jpg?height=156&width=234&top_left_y=1888&top_left_x=958)

Area $=a b$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-050.jpg?height=220&width=364&top_left_y=1823&top_left_x=1265)

Area $=(k a)(k b)=k^{2} a b$ of the given figure.

This illustrates an important general rule for all similar shapes.

When a figure is enlarged by a scale factor $k$, the area of the image figure is increased by a scale factor $k^{2}$.

## Example 2

The figure $\mathrm{P}^{\prime} \mathrm{Q}^{\prime} \mathrm{R}^{\prime} \mathrm{S}^{\prime}$ is an enlargement of the figure PQRS .
If the area of PQRS is $12 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and the area of $\mathrm{P}^{\prime} \mathrm{Q}^{\prime} \mathrm{R}^{\prime} \mathrm{S}=48 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, find the scale factor of the enlargement.

Let $k$ be the scale factor of the enlargement.
Area of $\mathrm{P}^{\prime} \mathrm{Q}^{\prime} \mathrm{R}^{\prime} \mathrm{S}^{\prime}=k^{2}$ (area of PQRS)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad 48 & =k^{2}(12) \\
12 k^{2} & =48 \\
k^{2} & =4 \\
k & =2
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-051.jpg?height=478&width=810&top_left_y=308&top_left_x=783)
$\therefore \quad$ the scale factor of the enlargement is 2 .

## Example 3

Two similar triangles have areas $12 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and $27 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, as shown.
If the base of the smaller triangle is 6 cm , find the base of the larger triangle.

Let the scale factor of the enlargement be $k$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-051.jpg?height=178&width=254&top_left_y=1264&top_left_x=816)

6 cm
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-051.jpg?height=281&width=404&top_left_y=1161&top_left_x=1137)
$x \mathrm{~cm}$

Area of larger triangle $=k^{2}$ (area of smaller triangle)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad 27=k^{2}(12) \\
& \Rightarrow \quad k^{2}=\frac{27}{12}=\frac{9}{4} \quad \Rightarrow \quad k=\frac{3}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Length of larger side $=k$ (length of smaller side)

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\Rightarrow & x=6 k \\
\Rightarrow & x=6\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \\
\Rightarrow & x=9 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{array}
$$

Length of base of larger triangle $=9 \mathrm{~cm}$

## Section 2.2 Constructions

In your study of constructions for the Junior Cycle, you will have learned:

- How to bisect a line segment
- How to bisect an angle
- How to construct various triangles
- How to draw parallel and perpendicular lines.

In this section we will deal with seven new constructions that are on the Leaving Certificate course as well as the application of these constructions to real-life situations. For these constructions you will need a compass, straight edge and protractor.

When you use a compass you must leave the construction arcs as evidence that you have used the correct method.

## 1. Constructing an angle of $60^{\circ}$

Each angle in an equilateral triangle is $60^{\circ}$. We will now use this information to draw an angle of $60^{\circ}$.

In an equilateral triangle, all the sides are equal in length.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-055.jpg?height=612&width=1402&top_left_y=406&top_left_x=209)
2. How to construct a tangent to a circle at a given point on it
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-055.jpg?height=291&width=289&top_left_y=1255&top_left_x=254)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-055.jpg?height=380&width=487&top_left_y=1201&top_left_x=577)

Join X to O , the centre of the circle. Place a ruler along OX and slide set square along the ruler until it reaches $X$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-055.jpg?height=390&width=517&top_left_y=1201&top_left_x=1076)

Draw a line $t$ through X perpendicular to OX . $t$ is a tangent to the circle k .
3. How to construct a parallelogram, given the lengths of the sides and the measures of the angles
The instructions below show how to construct a parallelogram ABCD where $|\mathrm{AB}|=3.5 \mathrm{~cm}$, $|\mathrm{AD}|=4 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $|\angle \mathrm{DAB}|=55^{\circ}$.

We first draw a rough sketch of $A B C D$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-056.jpg?height=367&width=586&top_left_y=175&top_left_x=862)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-056.jpg?height=343&width=305&top_left_y=625&top_left_x=253)

Draw a horizontal line $[\mathrm{AB}]=3.5 \mathrm{~cm}$. Use a protractor to measure an angle of $55^{\circ}$ at A . Draw a line through A and measure $|\mathrm{AD}|=4 \mathrm{~cm}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-056.jpg?height=392&width=494&top_left_y=617&top_left_x=625)

Place set square along the line AB . Use a ruler to slide the set square up to the point D . Draw a line through D parallel to AB .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-056.jpg?height=294&width=437&top_left_y=664&top_left_x=1163)

Use a compass with a radius of 3.5 cm (the same as $|\mathrm{AB}|$ ) to draw an arc on the line. $|\mathrm{DC}|=$ 3.5 cm . Join BC . ABCD is the required parallelogram.

## Circles and triangles

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-056.jpg?height=312&width=312&top_left_y=1428&top_left_x=400)

The circumcircle of a triangle is the circle which passes through the three vertices, as shown.
The centre, O , of this circle is called the circumcentre of the triangle.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-056.jpg?height=273&width=416&top_left_y=1450&top_left_x=1060)

A circle inscribed in a triangle such that all three sides touch the circle is called the incircle of the triangle. The centre of the incircle is called the incentre of the triangle. In the figure above, O is the incentre.

The construction of the circumcircle and incircle of a triangle will involve two constructions that you studied for your Junior Certificate examination.

The diagrams shown below will help you recall the steps involved in doing these constructions.

## The perpendicular bisector of a line segment The bisector of an angle

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-057.jpg?height=397&width=1151&top_left_y=231&top_left_x=449)

You should practise these constructions before attempting to draw the circumcircle and incircle of a triangle.

## 4. How to construct the circumcircle of a given triangle

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-057.jpg?height=289&width=399&top_left_y=841&top_left_x=239)

Construct the perpendicular bisector of [XY].
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-057.jpg?height=289&width=453&top_left_y=841&top_left_x=700)

Construct the perpendicular bisector of [XZ]. The two bisectors meet at the point O , as shown. O is the circumcentre.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-057.jpg?height=350&width=345&top_left_y=841&top_left_x=1235)

With O as centre and $|\mathrm{OX}|$ as radius, draw a circle through $\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}$ and Z . This is the circumcircle of the triangle.

## 5. How to construct the incircle of a given triangle

The construction of the incircle of a triangle involves constructing the bisector of an angle which is given on the previous page.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-057.jpg?height=291&width=343&top_left_y=1665&top_left_x=262)

Construct the bisector of $\angle \mathrm{XYZ}$, as shown.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-057.jpg?height=291&width=329&top_left_y=1665&top_left_x=689)

Now construct the bisector of $\angle \mathrm{XZY}$. The two bisectors meet at the point I. I is the incentre.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-057.jpg?height=305&width=328&top_left_y=1663&top_left_x=1175)

Use a set square to draw a perpendicular from I to the line YZ . The perpendicular meets YZ at H . With $|\mathrm{IH}|$ as radius, draw a circle to touch the three sides. This is the incircle of the triangle XYZ.

## 6. How to construct the centroid of a triangle

The line segment joining the vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side is called a median.

In the triangle below, $[\mathrm{XM}]$ is a median.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-058.jpg?height=261&width=435&top_left_y=414&top_left_x=294)

The point of intersection of the three medians of a triangle is called the centroid of the triangle.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-058.jpg?height=244&width=328&top_left_y=437&top_left_x=951)

## G is the centroid.

To find the midpoint of any line segment, we construct the perpendicular bisector of that line segment.

The diagram on the right should help you recall the steps involved in this construction.

The three diagrams below illustrate the steps to be followed in the construction of the centroid of a triangle.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-058.jpg?height=402&width=492&top_left_y=657&top_left_x=1140)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-058.jpg?height=282&width=366&top_left_y=1099&top_left_x=253)

Construct the perpendicular bisector of [XZ], as shown. M is the midpoint of [XZ].
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-058.jpg?height=289&width=371&top_left_y=1093&top_left_x=710)

Now construct the perpendicular bisector of $[\mathrm{XY}]$. N is the midpoint of [XY].
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-058.jpg?height=286&width=369&top_left_y=1097&top_left_x=1192)

Join YM and ZN. They meet at the point $\mathrm{G} . \mathrm{G}$ is the centroid of the triangle.

## 7. How to construct the orthocentre of a triangle

The perpendicular line segment drawn from the vertex of a triangle to the opposite side is called an altitude.

The point of intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle is called the orthocentre.

The point H is called the orthocentre.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-058.jpg?height=489&width=681&top_left_y=1598&top_left_x=952)

The diagrams below illustrate the steps involved in the construction of the orthocentre of a triangle.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-059.jpg?height=390&width=411&top_left_y=291&top_left_x=252)

Place the ruler along XZ and use the set square to draw the line YA perpendicular to XZ.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-059.jpg?height=381&width=444&top_left_y=293&top_left_x=709)

Use the ruler and set square to draw the line XB perpendicular to YZ .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-059.jpg?height=303&width=395&top_left_y=351&top_left_x=1203)

The lines YA and XB meet at the point $\mathrm{H} . \mathrm{H}$ is the orthocentre of the triangle.

## Applications of the given constructions

In the given diagram, the line $\ell$ is the perpendicular bisector of $[\mathrm{AB}]$.
Any point on this bisector is the same distance from A and B.
Thus $|\mathrm{AX}|=|\mathrm{XB}|$.

OP is the bisector of $\angle \mathrm{AOB}$. Any point on this bisector is equidistant from the arms of the angle. $|\mathrm{XY}|=|\mathrm{XZ}|$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-059.jpg?height=499&width=970&top_left_y=941&top_left_x=662)

Take any three points $\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}$ and Z .
How do we find a point that is the same distance from all three points?
Construct the perpendicular bisectors of $[\mathrm{XY}]$ and $[\mathrm{YZ}]$.
Name these lines $\ell$ and $m$.
Any point on $\ell$ is equidistant from X and Y .
Any point on $m$ is equidistant from Y and Z .
The lines $\ell$ and $m$ intersect at K .
K is equidistant from $\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{Y}$ and Z .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-059.jpg?height=399&width=553&top_left_y=1465&top_left_x=1079)

Equidistant means 'the same distance'.
The largest circle that can be drawn inside a triangle is the incircle, that is, the circle that touches all three sides.

## 3 Integration

## Key words

antidifferentiation integration integral integrand constant of integration exponential function velocity acceleration definite integral indefinite integral average value of a function intervals

## Section 3.1 Antidifferentiation

Consider the equation $y=x^{2}$.
Differentiating, we get $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=2 x$.
$2 x$ is the derivative of the function $y=x^{2}$.
From this we can see that when given the derivative $2 x$, we can write down the equation of the function, i.e. $y=x^{2}$.

The process of finding a function from its derivative is called antidifferentiation.
Now consider the functions shown: $y=x^{2}, y=x^{2}+1$ and $y=x^{2}+2$.
The derivative of each of these functions is $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=2 x$, as represented by the line shown in red.
The expressions $x^{2}, x^{2}+1$ and $x^{2}+2$ are said to be antiderivatives of $2 x$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-070.jpg?height=404&width=491&top_left_y=1524&top_left_x=674)

Starting with $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=2 x$, we have an infinite number of possibilities for $y$, all of the form $y=x^{2}+c$, where $c$ is an unknown constant.
We use the notation $\int 2 x d x=x^{2}+c$ to state that 'the general antiderivative of $2 x$ with respect to $x$ is $x^{2}+c$ ''

From the examples above, we can see that antidifferentiation is the reverse of differentiation.

Antidifferentiation is more commonly called integration.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { If } f^{\prime}(x) \text { is the derivative of } f(x) \text {, then } \int f^{\prime}(x) \mathrm{d} x=f(x)+c \text {. } \\
& \text { If } \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} \text { is the derivative of } y \text {, then } \int\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}\right) \mathrm{d} x=y+c \text {. }
\end{aligned}
$$

Now consider the following functions and their derivatives:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(x)=x^{2} \Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)=2 x \\
& f(x)=x^{3} \Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)=3 x^{2} \\
& f(x)=x^{7} \Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)=7 x^{6}
\end{aligned}
$$

Reversing this process, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int 2 x \mathrm{~d} x=x^{2} & \Rightarrow \int x \mathrm{~d} x=\frac{1}{2} x^{2}+c \\
\int 3 x^{2} \mathrm{~d} x=x^{3} & \Rightarrow \int x^{2} \mathrm{~d} x=\frac{1}{3} x^{3}+c \\
\int 7 x^{6} \mathrm{~d} x=x^{7} & \Rightarrow \int x^{6} \mathrm{~d} x=\frac{1}{7} x^{7}+c
\end{aligned}
$$

From this pattern, we can see that reversing the rule for differentiation produces a rule for integration as follows:

In general, $\int x^{n} \mathrm{~d} x=\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+c, n \neq-1$

## In words <br> To integrate a power of $x$, increase the power by 1 and divide by the new power.

Here are some useful results for integrating expressions that follow from the corresponding results for differentiation.

1. $\int a f(x) \mathrm{d} x=a \int f(x) \mathrm{d} x$, that is, any constant factor may be taken outside the integral sign.
2. $\int(f(x)+g(x)) \mathrm{d} x=\int f(x) \mathrm{d} x+\int g(x) \mathrm{d} x \ldots$ integrate each term separately.
3. $\int a \mathrm{~d} x=a x+c$, since $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x}(a x+c)=a$, where $a$ is a constant.

To integrate a function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, we write

$$
\int f(x) \mathrm{d} x .
$$

We read this as 'the integral of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ '.
The function to be integrated, i.e. $f(x)$, is called the integrand.

## Example 1

Find
(i) $\int\left(3 x^{2}+4 x+5\right) \mathrm{d} x$
(ii) $\int(2 x-1)^{2} \mathrm{~d} x$.
(i) $\int\left(3 x^{2}+4 x+5\right) \mathrm{d} x=\frac{3 x^{3}}{3}+\frac{4 x^{2}}{2}+5 x+c$

$$
=x^{3}+2 x^{2}+5 x+c \quad \ldots \text { don't forget to include } c
$$

(ii) $\int(2 x-1)^{2} \mathrm{~d} x=\int\left(4 x^{2}-4 x+1\right) \mathrm{d} x=\frac{4 x^{3}}{3}-\frac{4 x^{2}}{2}+x+c$

$$
=\frac{4 x^{3}}{3}-2 x^{2}+x+c
$$

Some expressions are not in the form $a x^{n}$ or are not written as a sum or difference of functions of this form. In these cases, it is necessary to change the integrand so that each term is in the form $a x^{n}$.

## Example 2

Find
(i) $\int \frac{x^{3}-4 x}{x} \mathrm{~d} x$
(ii) $\int\left(x^{3}+\frac{1}{x^{2}}+\sqrt{x}\right) \mathrm{d} x$
(iii) $\int \sqrt{x}(x+4) \mathrm{d} x$
(i) $\int \frac{x^{3}-4 x}{x} \mathrm{~d} x=\int\left(\frac{x^{3}}{x}-\frac{4 x}{x}\right) \mathrm{d} x=\int\left(x^{2}-4\right) \mathrm{d} x=\frac{x^{3}}{3}-4 x+c$
(ii) $\int\left(x^{3}+\frac{1}{x^{2}}+\sqrt{x}\right) \mathrm{d} x=\int\left(x^{3}+x^{-2}+x^{\frac{1}{2}}\right) \mathrm{d} x$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{x^{4}}{4}+\frac{x^{-1}}{-1}+\frac{x^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\frac{3}{2}}+c \\
& =\frac{x^{4}}{4}-\frac{1}{x}+\frac{2}{3} x^{\frac{3}{2}}+c
\end{aligned}
$$

(iii) $\int \sqrt{x}(x+4) \mathrm{d} x=\int\left(x^{\frac{3}{2}}+4 x^{\frac{1}{2}}\right) \mathrm{d} x$

$$
=\frac{x^{\frac{5}{2}}}{\frac{5}{2}}+\frac{4 x^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\frac{3}{2}}+c=\frac{2}{5} x^{\frac{5}{2}}+\frac{8}{3} x^{\frac{3}{2}}+c
$$

## Finding the constant of integration

Each of the examples above contain an arbitrary constant $c$.
This arbitrary constant is generally called the constant of integration.
This constant of integration can be found if further information about the function is given.
This is illustrated in the following example.

## Example 3

A curve with equation $y=f(x)$ passes through the point $(2,0)$.
If $f^{\prime}(x)=3 x^{2}-\frac{1}{x^{2}}$, find $f(x)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x)=\int\left(3 x^{2}-\frac{1}{x^{2}}\right) \mathrm{d} x & =\int\left(3 x^{2}-x^{-2}\right) \mathrm{d} x \\
& =\frac{3 x^{3}}{3}-\frac{x^{-1}}{-1}=x^{3}+\frac{1}{x}+c \\
f(x)=x^{3}+\frac{1}{x}+c &
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the curve contains $(2,0)$, then $(2,0)$ satisfies the equation $y=f(x)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow 0=2^{3}+\frac{1}{2}+c \\
& \Rightarrow 0=\frac{17}{2}+c \Rightarrow c=-\frac{17}{2} \\
& \therefore f(x)=x^{3}+\frac{1}{x}-\frac{17}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 3.2 Integrating exponential and trigonometric functions

In chapter 7, T\&T4 it was found that if
(i) $f(x)=\mathrm{e}^{x}$, then $f^{\prime}(x)=\mathrm{e}^{x} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \int \mathrm{e}^{x} \mathrm{~d} x=\mathrm{e}^{x}+c$
(ii) $f(x)=\mathrm{e}^{a x}$, then $f^{\prime}(x)=a \mathrm{e}^{a x} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \int \mathrm{e}^{a x} \mathrm{~d} x=\frac{1}{a} \mathrm{e}^{a x}+c$
(iii) $f(x)=a^{x}$, then $f^{\prime}(x)=a^{x} \ln a \Rightarrow \quad \int a^{x} \mathrm{~d} x=\frac{a^{x}}{\ln a}+c$

## Example 1

Find each of the following:
(i) $\int \mathrm{e}^{3 x} \mathrm{~d} x$
(ii) $\int\left(\mathrm{e}^{4 x}+6 x\right) \mathrm{d} x$
(iii) $\int\left(\mathrm{e}^{5 x}+2\right) \mathrm{d} x$
(iv) $\int\left(\mathrm{e}^{x}+\mathrm{e}^{-x}\right) \mathrm{d} x$
(i) $\int \mathrm{e}^{3 x} \mathrm{~d} x=\frac{1}{3} \mathrm{e}^{3 x}+c$
(ii) $\int\left(\mathrm{e}^{4 x}+6 x\right) \mathrm{d} x=\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{e}^{4 x}+\frac{6 x^{2}}{2}+c$

$$
=\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{e}^{4 x}+3 x^{2}+c
$$

(iii) $\int\left(\mathrm{e}^{5 x}+2\right) \mathrm{d} x=\frac{1}{5} \mathrm{e}^{5 x}+2 x+c$
(iv) $\int\left(\mathrm{e}^{x}+\mathrm{e}^{-x}\right) \mathrm{d} x=\mathrm{e}^{x}+\frac{\mathrm{e}^{-x}}{-1}+c$ $=\mathrm{e}^{x}-\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}^{x}}+c$

## Example 2

Given $y=5^{x}$, show that $\int 5^{x} \mathrm{~d} x=\frac{5^{x}}{\ln 5}+c$.
We know that if $y=5^{x} \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=5^{x} \ln 5 \quad$ (check p25 formulae and tables)
$\therefore \mathrm{d} y=5^{x} \ln 5 \mathrm{~d} x$
$\therefore \quad y=\int 5^{x} \ln 5 \mathrm{~d} x$
$\therefore \quad y=\ln 5 \int 5^{x} \mathrm{~d} x$
$\therefore \quad \int 5^{x} \mathrm{~d} x=\frac{y}{\ln 5}+c=\frac{5^{x}}{\ln 5}+c$

## Integrals of the form $\int \sin a x$ and $\int \cos a x$

In our study of differential calculus, we found the derivatives of $\sin x, \sin a x, \cos x$ and $\cos a x$.

We will now use these results to write down the standard integrals of the basic trigonometric functions.
(i) $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x} \sin x=\cos x \quad \Rightarrow \quad \int \cos x \mathrm{~d} x=\sin x+c$
(ii) $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x} \sin a x=a \cos a x \quad \Rightarrow \quad \int \cos a x \mathrm{~d} x=\frac{\sin a x}{a}+c$
(iii) $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x} \cos x=-\sin x \quad \Rightarrow \quad \int \sin x \mathrm{~d} x=-\cos x+c$
(iv) $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x} \cos a x=-a \sin a x \quad \Rightarrow \quad \int \sin a x \mathrm{~d} x=-\frac{\cos a x}{a}+c$

## Example 3

Find (i) $\int \cos 4 x d x \quad$ (ii) $\int \sin 3 x d x$.
(i) $\int \cos 4 x \mathrm{~d} x=\frac{\sin 4 x}{4}+c=\frac{1}{4} \sin 4 x+c$
(ii) $\int \sin 3 x \mathrm{~d} x=-\frac{\cos 3 x}{3}+c=-\frac{1}{3} \cos 3 x+c$

## Example 4

If $y=\sin 3 x^{2}$, find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.
Hence, find $\int 6 x \cos 3 x^{2} \mathrm{~d} x$.
$y=\sin 3 x^{2} \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\cos 3 x^{2} \times \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x}\left(3 x^{2}\right) \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=6 x \cos 3 x^{2}$
Since $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=6 x \cos 3 x^{2} \Rightarrow \int 6 x \cos 3 x^{2} \mathrm{~d} x=\sin 3 x^{2}+c$

## Example 5

Let $h(x)=x \ln x, x \in R, x>0$.
(i) Find $h^{\prime}(x)$.
(ii) Hence, find $\int \ln x \mathrm{~d} x$.
(i)

$$
\begin{aligned}
h(x) & =x \ln x \\
h^{\prime}(x) & =x \cdot \frac{1}{x}+\ln x \times 1 \quad \ldots 1 \text { st } \times \text { derivative of } 2 \text { nd }+2 \text { nd } \times \text { derivative of } 1 \text { st } \\
h^{\prime}(x) & =1+\ln x
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $\quad \int(1+\ln x) \mathrm{d} x=x \ln x \quad \ldots$ from (i) above

But $\int(1+\ln x) \mathrm{d} x=\int 1 \mathrm{~d} x+\int \ln x \mathrm{~d} x$

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
\therefore & & \int 1 \mathrm{~d} x+\int \ln x \mathrm{~d} x & =x \ln x \\
\therefore & & \int \ln x \mathrm{~d} x & =x \ln x-\int 1 \mathrm{~d} x \\
& & =x \ln x-x \\
\therefore & & \int \ln x \mathrm{~d} x & =x \ln x-x+c
\end{array}
$$

## Section 3.3 Applications of integration

In our study of differential calculus, we learned that in an equation of the type

$$
s=2 t^{2}-3 t+4,
$$

$s$ represents the displacement of a body from some fixed origin after $t$ seconds.
We also learned that $\frac{\mathrm{d} s}{\mathrm{~d} t}$ represents the speed or velocity $v$.
The acceleration, $a$, of a body is defined as the rate of change of the velocity with respect to time,
that is, $\frac{\mathrm{d} v}{\mathrm{~d} t}=a \quad$ or $\quad \frac{\mathrm{d} v}{\mathrm{~d} t}=\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} s}{\mathrm{~d} t^{2}}$.
Accordingly displacement, velocity and acceleration are linked together by the process of differentiation with respect to time.

In reverse order, $a, v$ and $s$ are linked together by integration.
If we integrate an expression for the acceleration of a body with respect to time, we obtain an expression for the velocity of the body.

This is summarised diagramatically on the right.

## Differentiate with respect to time

displacement - velocity - acceleration

$$
s=a
$$

## Integrate with respect to time

## Example 1

A body moves in a straight line.
At time $t$ seconds, its acceleration is given by $a=6 t+1$.
When $t=0$, the velocity of the body is $2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$ and its displacement from a fixed point O is 1 metre.
(i) Find expressions for $v$ and $s$ in terms of $t$.
(ii) Find the velocity of the body after 4 seconds.
(i) Given $a=6 t+1$, i.e. $\frac{\mathrm{d} v}{\mathrm{~d} t}=6 t+1$

Velocity $(v)=\int(6 t+1) \mathrm{d} t$
$\therefore \quad v=\frac{6 t^{2}}{2}+t+c$, i.e. $v=3 t^{2}+t+c$
When $t=0, v=2$; thus, $2=0+0+c \quad \therefore \quad c=2$
Thus, $v=3 t^{2}+t+2 \quad \ldots c=2$

Using $\quad v=\frac{\mathrm{d} s}{\mathrm{~d} t}=3 t^{2}+t+2$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad s & =\int\left(3 t^{2}+t+2\right) \mathrm{d} t \\
s & =\frac{3 t^{3}}{3}+\frac{t^{2}}{2}+2 t+c \\
s & =t^{3}+\frac{t^{2}}{2}+2 t+c
\end{aligned}
$$

When $t=0, s=1 \Rightarrow 1=0+c \Rightarrow c=1$
Thus, $s=t^{3}+\frac{t^{2}}{2}+2 t+1$
(ii) Velocity $=v=3 t^{2}+t+2$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow v & =3(4)^{2}+(4)+2 \quad \ldots \text { when } t=4 \\
v & =54 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec} \text { when } t=4
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the velocity $=54 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$ after 4 seconds.

## Exercise 3.3

In questions (1-5), $s$ metres represents displacement relative to a fixed point $\mathrm{O}, v \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$ represents velocity, and $a \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}^{2}$ represents acceleration.

(i) the velocity, $v$, and displacement, $s$, in terms of $t$
(ii) the velocity and displacement when $t=2$ seconds.

(i) the body's velocity at any time in terms of time $t$
(ii) its height, $s$, above the point of projection at any time
(iii) the time it takes to reach its maximum height
(iv) the maximum height reached
(v) the time taken to return to the point of projection.

## Section 3.4 Definite integrals

The diagram on the right shows the line $y=x$. The shaded triangle is the area of the region between the line $y=x$ and the $x$-axis between the values $x=0$ and $x=3$.
Thus, the area is $\frac{1}{2}(3)(3)=4 \frac{1}{2}$ square units.
The equation of the line is $y=x$ or $f(x)=x$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-081.jpg?height=313&width=402&top_left_y=1852&top_left_x=1131)

$$
\int f(x) \mathrm{d} x=\int x \mathrm{~d} x=\frac{x^{2}}{2}+c
$$

If we evaluate this integral at $x=3$ and $x=0$ and subtract the results, we get:

$$
\left[\frac{9}{2}+c\right]-\left[\frac{0}{2}+c\right]=\frac{9}{2}+c-c=\frac{9}{2}=4 \frac{1}{2}
$$

This result gives us the area of the shaded region already found by a different method on the previous page. It illustrates the use of integral calculus in finding the area between a line or curve and the $x$-axis.
$\int_{0}^{3} f(x) \mathrm{d} x$ is the area between the curve $y=f(x)$ and the $x$-axis from $x=0$ to $x=3$.
The area is found by evaluating the integral at $x=3$ and $x=0$ and then subtracting the results.

The area enclosed between the curve $y=f(x)$, the $x$-axis and the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ is given by

$$
\text { Area }=\int_{a}^{b} y \mathrm{~d} x
$$

The area above may be written as
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-082.jpg?height=328&width=348&top_left_y=680&top_left_x=1283)

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f^{\prime}(x) \mathrm{d} x=[f(x)]_{a}^{b}=f(b)-f(a)
$$

Note: 1. $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d} x$ is called a definite integral since it gives a definite answer. $\int(2 x+3) \mathrm{d} x=x^{2}+3 x+c$ is called an indefinite integral as it contains an unknown constant $c$.
2. The numbers $a$ and $b$ are called the limits of integration, $a$ being the lower limit and $b$ the upper limit.
3. The constant of integration may be ignored in definite integrals since the two $c$ 's cancel out when evaluating $f(b)-f(\mathrm{a})$.

Areas under a curve will be dealt with more fully in the next section.

$$
\begin{aligned}

& =6-4=2
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $\int_{2}^{5} 4 \mathrm{e}^{x} \mathrm{~d} x=4 \int_{2}^{5} \mathrm{e}^{x} \mathrm{~d} x=4\left[\mathrm{e}^{x}\right]_{2}^{5}$

=4\left[\mathrm{e}^{5}-\mathrm{e}^{2}\right]
$$

(iii) $\int_{0}^{2} 9^{x} \mathrm{~d} x=\left[\frac{9^{x}}{\ln 9}\right]_{0}^{2}=\left[\frac{9^{2}}{\ln 9}\right]-\left[\frac{9^{0}}{\ln 9}\right]$

$$
=\left[\frac{81}{\ln 9}\right]-\left[\frac{1}{\ln 9}\right]=\frac{81}{\ln 9}-\frac{1}{\ln 9}=\frac{80}{\ln 9}

## Section 3.5 Finding areas by integration

In this section, we will show how integration can be used to find the area, $A$, between a curve $y=f(x)$ and the $x$-axis from $x=a$ to $x=b$, as represented by the shaded area in the diagram on the right.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-085.jpg?height=345&width=580&top_left_y=264&top_left_x=1049)

One way to estimate the area would be to divide it into a large number of rectangular strips, as shown below. Since each of these strips approximates to a rectangle, the sum of the areas of those rectangles gives an approximate value for $A$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-085.jpg?height=472&width=473&top_left_y=806&top_left_x=367)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-085.jpg?height=472&width=465&top_left_y=806&top_left_x=998)

We will now consider one such rectangle, as shown on the right above.
Let the area under the curve from $x=a$ to $x=x$ be $A(x)$, and the area from $x=a$ to $x=x+h$ be $A(x+h)$.
The area of the narrow (shaded) strip is approximately equal to $h . f(x)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow A(x+h)-A(x) \approx f(x) \cdot h \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{A(x+h)-A(x)}{h} \approx f(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

As $h \rightarrow 0 \Rightarrow \lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{A(x+h)-A(x)}{h}=f(x)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathrm{~d} x}=f(x) \\
& \Rightarrow \mathrm{d} A=f(x) \mathrm{d} x \\
& \Rightarrow A=\int f(x) \mathrm{d} x
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus the integral of the function $y=f(x)$ gives the area function $A(x)$.
If we substitute $b$ and $a$ for $x$, we get the area between the curve, the $x$-axis and the lines $x=b$ and $x=a$.

Area under a Curve

The area, $A$, of the region between the curve $y=f(x)$ and the $x$-axis between the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ is given by

$$
A=\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d} x
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-086.jpg?height=317&width=520&top_left_y=221&top_left_x=1074)

When using $\int_{a}^{b} y \mathrm{~d} x$ to find the area between a curve and the $x$-axis, the areas of the regions above and below the $x$-axis must be found separately. If $b>a$, the value of $\int_{a}^{b} y \mathrm{~d} x$ will be positive if the area enclosed is above the $x$-axis, and negative if the area is below the $x$-axis.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-086.jpg?height=350&width=550&top_left_y=664&top_left_x=1083)

If an area is -16 , we take the absolute value, 16 , to be the area.

## Area between a curve and the $\boldsymbol{y}$-axis

If we require the area between a curve and the $y$-axis, the function must be written in the form $\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{y})$.

The area of the shaded region between the curve and the $y$-axis between the lines $y=b$ and $y=a$ is given by:

## Area between a curve and the $y$-axis

$$
\text { Area } A=\int_{a}^{b} x \mathrm{~d} y
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-086.jpg?height=407&width=413&top_left_y=1251&top_left_x=1222)

If the region is to the right of the $y$-axis, the area is positive; if the region is to the left of the $y$-axis, the area is negative.

Areas to the right and to the left of the $y$-axis must be found separately and then added.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-086.jpg?height=352&width=331&top_left_y=1752&top_left_x=1301)

## Example 1

Find the area of the shaded region shown in the given diagram.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Area } & =\int_{2}^{4}\left(x^{2}-4\right) \mathrm{d} x+\int_{1}^{2}\left(x^{2}-4\right) \mathrm{d} x \\
& =\left[\frac{x^{3}}{3}-4 x\right]_{2}^{4}+\left[\frac{x^{3}}{3}-4 x\right]_{1}^{2} \\
& =\frac{64}{3}-16-\left(\frac{8}{3}-8\right)+\left[\left(\frac{8}{3}-8\right)-\left(\frac{1}{3}-4\right)\right] \\
& =\frac{64}{3}-16-\left(-\frac{16}{3}\right)+\left[-\frac{16}{3}-\left(-\frac{11}{3}\right)\right] \\
& =\frac{64}{3}-16+\frac{16}{3}+\left[-\frac{16}{3}+\frac{11}{3}\right] \\
& =\frac{80}{3}-16+\left[-\frac{5}{3}\right] \quad \ldots \text { since area below the } x \text {-axis is negative, we take the absolute } \\
& =\frac{32}{3}+\left|-\frac{5}{3}\right|=\frac{32}{3}+\frac{5}{3}=\frac{37}{3} \text { square units. }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Area between two curves

The given figure shows two curves $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ intersecting at the points where $x=a$ and $x=b$.

The shaded area $=\int_{a}^{b} g(x) \mathrm{d} x-\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d} x$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-087.jpg?height=430&width=536&top_left_y=1466&top_left_x=1095)

## Example 2

Find the area of the region bounded by the curve $y=-x^{2}+5 x-4$ and the line $y=x-1$.

The curve $y=-x^{2}+5 x-4$ represents a quadratic curve with a maximum turning point as the coefficient of $x^{2}$ is negative.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y=0 & \Rightarrow-x^{2}+5 x-4=0 \\
& \Rightarrow x^{2}-5 x+4=0 \\
& \Rightarrow(x-4)(x-1)=0 \\
& \Rightarrow x=4 \text { or } x=1
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad$ The curve intersects the $x$-axis at $x=4$ and at $x=1$.
A rough sketch of the curve is shown.
We use simultaneous equations to find
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-088.jpg?height=380&width=585&top_left_y=522&top_left_x=957) the point of intersection of the curve and the line.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y & =-x^{2}+5 x-4 \text { and } y=x-1 \\
& \Rightarrow-x^{2}+5 x-4=x-1 \\
& \Rightarrow x^{2}-4 x+3=0 \\
& \Rightarrow(x-3)(x-1)=0 \Rightarrow x=3 \text { or } x=1
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the curve intersects the line at the points where $x=1$ and $x=3$.
(There is no need to find the corresponding $y$-values.)
The required shaded area is the area between the curve and the $x$-axis between $x=3$ and $x=1$ less the area between the line and the $x$-axis between $x=3$ and $x=1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Area } & =\int_{1}^{3}\left(-x^{2}+5 x-4\right) \mathrm{d} x-\int_{1}^{3}(x-1) \mathrm{d} x \\
& =\left[-\frac{x^{3}}{3}+\frac{5 x^{2}}{2}-4 x\right]_{1}^{3}-\left[\frac{x^{2}}{2}-x\right]_{1}^{3} \\
& =\left[\left(-9+\frac{45}{2}-12\right)-\left(-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{5}{2}-4\right)\right]-\left[\left(\frac{9}{2}-3\right)-\left(\frac{1}{2}-1\right)\right] \\
& =\left[\frac{3}{2}+\frac{11}{6}\right]-\left[\frac{3}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\right] \\
& =\frac{4}{3} \text { sq. units }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

The diagram on the right shows a sketch of the function $y=\frac{2}{x^{2}}$.
The shaded region represents the area bounded by the curve and the $x$-axis between the lines $x=3$ and $x=1$.

If the line $x=k$ divides this area into two equal portions, find the value of $k$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-089.jpg?height=435&width=503&top_left_y=275&top_left_x=1106)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& A_{1}=A_{2} \\
\Rightarrow & \int_{k}^{3} \frac{2}{x^{2}} \mathrm{~d} x=\int_{1}^{k} \frac{2}{x^{2}} \mathrm{~d} x \\
\Rightarrow & \int_{k}^{3} 2 x^{-2} \mathrm{~d} x=\int_{1}^{k} 2 x^{-2} \mathrm{~d} x \\
\Rightarrow & {\left[\frac{2 x^{-1}}{-1}\right]_{k}^{3}=\left[\frac{2 x^{-1}}{-1}\right]_{1}^{k} } \\
\Rightarrow & {\left[-\frac{2}{x}\right]_{k}^{3}=\left[-\frac{2}{x}\right]_{1}^{k} } \\
\Rightarrow & \left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)-\left(-\frac{2}{k}\right)=\left(-\frac{2}{k}\right)-\left(-\frac{2}{1}\right) \\
\Rightarrow & -\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{k}=-\frac{2}{k}+2 \\
\Rightarrow & \frac{4}{k}=2 \frac{2}{3} \Rightarrow \frac{4}{k}=\frac{8}{3} \Rightarrow 8 k=12 \Rightarrow k=\frac{3}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 3.6 Average value of a function

In some cases it is useful to know the average value of a function, especially if the function is periodic.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-093.jpg?height=261&width=508&top_left_y=1423&top_left_x=1123)

The average value of a continuous function over a given interval (e.g. $f(x)=6+6 x^{2}-x^{3}$ from $x=1$ to $x=5$ ) is defined as the height of a rectangle standing on the same interval ( $5-1=4$ ) which has the same area as the area trapped between the function and the $x$-axis.
i.e. Average value $\times 4=\int_{1}^{5}\left(6+6 x^{2}-x^{3}\right) \mathrm{d} x=116$
$\Rightarrow$ average value of $f(x)$, from $x=1$ to $x=5$,

$$
=116 \div 4=29
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-093.jpg?height=491&width=569&top_left_y=1730&top_left_x=1062)

In general terms the average value of $y=f(x)$, over an interval of $[a, b]$ is defined as the height of the rectangle that has the same area as the area between the $x$-axis and the curve for the interval $[a, b]$.
The exact average value can be found using integration.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-094.jpg?height=310&width=486&top_left_y=170&top_left_x=1143)

The average value of a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is

$$
\text { Average value }=\frac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d} x
$$

## Example 1

The graph of the function, $f(x)=x^{2}-4 x+5$ is shown. Find the average value of the function for $1 \leqslant x \leqslant 4$.

\text { Average value } & =\frac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d} x \\
& =\frac{1}{4-1} \int_{1}^{4}\left(x^{2}-4 x+5\right) \mathrm{d} x \\
& =\frac{1}{3}\left[\frac{x^{3}}{3}-\frac{4 x^{2}}{2}+5 x\right]_{1}^{4}=\frac{1}{3}\left[\frac{x^{3}}{3}-2 x^{2}+5 x\right]_{1}^{4} \\

## Example 2

A body starts from rest and moves in a straight line.
After $t$ seconds its velocity ( $v \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$ ) is given by $v=2 t-4, t \geqslant 0$.
(i) By completing the table on the right, estimate the average velocity over the first 3 seconds.

| $\boldsymbol{t}=$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\boldsymbol{v}=$ |  |  |  |  |

(ii) Use integration to test the accuracy of your answer.
(i)

| $\boldsymbol{t}=$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| $\boldsymbol{v}=$ | -4 | -2 | 0 | 2 |

Average velocity $=\frac{-4-2+0+2}{4}=-1 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{sec} \quad \ldots$ although $t=3$ seconds, four readings were taken.
(ii) The average value of a function $f(x)$ is $\frac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d} x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Average velocity } & =\frac{1}{3-0} \int_{0}^{3}(2 t-4) \mathrm{d} t \\
& =\frac{1}{3}\left[\frac{2 t^{2}}{2}-4 t\right]_{0}^{3}=\frac{1}{3}\left[t^{2}-4 t\right]_{0}^{3} \\
& =\frac{1}{3}\left[\left(3^{2}-4(3)\right)-(0-0)\right] \\
& =\frac{1}{3}[9-12]=\frac{1}{3}[-3]=-1 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$$

In this case, the average velocity is also $-1 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$.
This is the true average velocity; the first method only gives an estimate.
The estimate in (i) obtained by sampling was accurate in this example but for most functions is not.

## Example 3

The average value of the function $f(x)=2 x+3$ for $1 \leqslant x \leqslant k$ is 11 .
Find the value of $k$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Average value } & =\frac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d} x \\
& =\frac{1}{k-1} \int_{a}^{b}(2 x+3) \mathrm{d} x \\
& =\frac{1}{k-1}\left[\frac{2 x^{2}}{2}+3 x\right]_{1}^{k} \\
& =\frac{1}{k-1}\left[\left(k^{2}+3 k\right)-(1+3)\right] \\
& =\frac{1}{k-1}\left[k^{2}+3 k-4\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad \frac{1}{k-1}\left(k^{2}+3 k-4\right)=11 \quad \ldots$ the average value, 11, is given.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore \quad & k^{2}+3 k-4=11(k-1) \\
& k^{2}-8 k+7=0 \\
& (k-7)(k-1)=0 \\
& k=7 \text { or } k=1 \\
\therefore \quad & k=7 \quad \ldots k=1 \text { is the second limit, already given. }
\end{array}
$$

## Section 4.1 Tangents - Increasing and decreasing functions

In chapter 7 book 4, it was stated that for any function $y=f(x)$, the derived function $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ can be interpreted geometrically as the slope of the tangent to the curve at any point on the curve.

If $y=f(x)$, then $f^{\prime}(a)$ gives the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point where $x=a$.
Thus, to find the equation of the tangent to a curve at the point $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ :
(i) Find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.
(ii) Evaluate $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ at $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$.
(iii) Use the equation

$$
y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right)

to find the equation of the tangent at the point $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$.

## Example 1

Find the equation of the tangent to the curve $y=\frac{x^{2}}{3}-x+1$ at the point $\left(4, \frac{7}{3}\right)$.
To find the slope of the tangent to the curve, we first find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y=\frac{x^{2}}{3}-x+1 \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{2 x}{3}-1 \\
& =\frac{2(4)}{3}-1=\frac{5}{3} \quad \ldots \text { at } x=4
\end{aligned}
$$

Equation of tangent at $\left(4, \frac{7}{3}\right)$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right) \\
& y-\frac{7}{3}=\frac{5}{3}(x-4) \\
& \Rightarrow 3 y-7=5 x-20 \\
& \Rightarrow 5 x-3 y-13=0 \text { is the required equation. }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 2

At what points on the curve $y=x^{3}-9 x^{2}+20 x-8$ is the tangent parallel to the line $4 x+y-3=0$ ?

The slope of the line $4 x+y-3=0$ is $-4 . \quad \ldots y=-4 x+3$
Any line parallel to $4 x+y-3=0$ will have slope -4 .
We find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ to find the slope of any tangent to $y=x^{3}-9 x^{2}+20 x-8$.

$$
\frac{d y}{d x}=3 x^{2}-18 x+20
$$

For slope $-4, \quad 3 x^{2}-18 x+20=-4$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow 3 x^{2}-18 x+24=0 \\
& \Rightarrow x^{2}-6 x+8=0 \\
& \Rightarrow(x-2)(x-4)=0 \Rightarrow x=2 \text { or } x=4
\end{aligned}
$$

We now find the corresponding $y$-values for $x=2$ and $x=4$.

$$
x=2 \Rightarrow y=(2)^{3}-9(2)^{2}+20(2)-8 \Rightarrow y=4
$$

$\therefore(2,4)$ is one point where the slope is -4 .

$$
x=4 \Rightarrow y=(4)^{3}-9(4)^{2}+20(4)-8 \Rightarrow y=-8
$$

$\therefore(4,-8)$ is a second point where the slope is -4
$\therefore$ The two required points are $(2,4)$ and $(4,-8)$.

## Increasing and decreasing functions

Examining the given curve from left to right, we can see that it is rising (or increasing) from $A$ to $B$, and decreasing from $B$ to $C$.
From A to B, the slope of the tangent (i.e. $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ ) is positive.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-106.jpg?height=270&width=564&top_left_y=1916&top_left_x=1071)

From B to C , the slope of the tangent is negative.

When the curve is increasing, $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}>0$.
When the curve is decreasing, $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}<0$.

## Example 3

Find the interval for which the function $f(x)=x^{3}-3 x^{2}-9 x+9$ is
(i) increasing
(ii) decreasing
(i) When $f(x)$ is increasing, $f^{\prime}(x)>0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f^{\prime}(x)=3 x^{2}-6 x-9 & \Rightarrow 3 x^{2}-6 x-9>0 \\
& \Rightarrow x^{2}-2 x-3>0 \\
& \Rightarrow(x-3)(x+1)>0
\end{aligned}
$$

Using a rough sketch of the quadratic function $y=x^{2}-2 x-3$, we can see that:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-107.jpg?height=315&width=408&top_left_y=762&top_left_x=1135)
$(x-3)(x+1)>0 \Rightarrow x>3$ and $x<-1$.
Therefore, $f(x)$ is increasing when $x>3$ and $x<-1$.
(ii) When $f(x)$ is decreasing, $f^{\prime}(x)$ is negative.

From the graph, $f^{\prime}(x)$ is negative when $(x-3)(x+1)<0$, i.e. when $x>-1$ and $x<3$.
$\therefore f(x)$ is decreasing in the interval $-1<x<3$.

## Example 4

Show that the curve $y=x^{3}+3 x^{2}+6 x$ is increasing for all values of $x \in R$.
If a curve is increasing, then $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ is positive.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y=x^{3}+3 x^{2}+6 x \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =3 x^{2}+6 x+6 \\
& =3\left(x^{2}+2 x+2\right) \\
& =3\left(x^{2}+2 x+1+1\right) \\
& =3\left[(x+1)^{2}+1\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $(x+1)^{2}, x \in R$ is always positive, then $3\left[(x+1)^{2}+1\right]$ is positive.
Therefore, the curve is increasing for all $x \in R$ as $3\left[(x+1)^{2}+1\right]$ is positive for all $x \in R$.

## Section 4.2 Stationary points

In the diagram below, the tangents to the curve at the points A and B are parallel to the $x$-axis, and so the slope of each tangent is zero.
Points on a curve at which $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ is zero are called stationary points.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-110.jpg?height=465&width=1234&top_left_y=1003&top_left_x=302)

In the curve above, A and B are stationary points and they are also turning points.
The turning point at A is called a local maximum point, since the value of the function at this point exceeds all values of the function immediately to the right or left of A .

A maximum value of a function is not necessarily the greatest value of the function.
This is illustrated in the curve above where the value of the function at C is greater than the value of the function at A .

The turning point at B above is called a minimum turning point or simply a local minimum.
The following steps should be used to find the turning points of a curve:
(i) find $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ of the function
(ii) let $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0$ and solve the equation
(iii) for each value of $x$, find the corresponding value for $y$.

## Example 1

Find the turning points of the curve $y=x+\frac{1}{x}$.
To find the turning points, we solve the equation $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y=x+\frac{1}{x} \Rightarrow y=x+x^{-1} \\
& \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=1-\frac{1}{x^{2}} \\
& \begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0 \Rightarrow 1-\frac{1}{x^{2}}=0 & \Rightarrow x^{2}-1=0 \\
& \Rightarrow x^{2}=1 \Rightarrow x= \pm 1
\end{aligned} \\
& x=1 \Rightarrow y=2 \text { and } x=-1 \Rightarrow y=-2
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore$ The turning points of the curve are $(1,2)$ and $(-1,-2)$.

## Determining the nature of a turning point

In the diagram below, the positive signs (+) indicate where the slope of the curve is positive (i.e. $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}>0$ ), and the negative signs indicate where the slope of the curve is negative $\left(\right.$ i.e. $\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}<0\right)$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-111.jpg?height=336&width=720&top_left_y=1218&top_left_x=559)

As the point A is approached from the left, the slope of the curve is positive but decreasing; at A , the slope is zero, and to the right of A , the slope is negative. Thus, as we go through the point A , the slope of the curve changes from positive to negative (i.e. is decreasing).
Thus, the rate of change of $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ (i.e. $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$ ) is negative.
$\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$ is negative at a maximum turning point.
Similarly, at the point B , the slope of the curve changes from negative to positive, that is, it is increasing.
Thus, the rate of change of $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}\left(\right.$ i.e. $\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}\right)$ is positive at the point B .
$\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$ is positive at a minimum turning point.

The second derivative test for turning points

If, $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}<0$, i.e. is negative, at a point, then the point is a local maximum point.
If, $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}>0$, i.e. is positive, at a point, then the point is a local minimum point.

## Example 2

Find the turning points of the curve $y=x^{3}-9 x^{2}+15 x$ and determine the nature of these turning points.
To find the turning points, we solve the equation $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y=x^{3}-9 x^{2}+15 x & \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=3 x^{2}-18 x+15 \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0 & \Rightarrow 3 x^{2}-18 x+15=0 \\
& \Rightarrow x^{2}-6 x+5=0 \\
& \Rightarrow(x-5)(x-1)=0 \\
& \Rightarrow x=5 \text { or } x=1
\end{aligned}
$$

When $x=5, y=(5)^{3}-9(5)^{2}+15(5) \Rightarrow y=-25$
$\therefore(5,-25)$ is a turning point.
When $x=1, y=(1)^{3}-9(1)^{2}+15(1)=7$
$\therefore(1,7)$ is also a turning point.
To determine the nature of these turning points, we find $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$.
$\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=3 x^{2}-18 x+15 \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=6 x-18$
At $x=5, \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=6(5)-18=12$, which is positive.
$\Rightarrow(5,-25)$ is a minimum turning point.
At $x=1, \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=6(1)-18=-12$, which is negative.
$\Rightarrow(1,7)$ is a maximum turning point.

## Points of Inflection

The curve traced in the diagram below is said to be concave upwards from the point A to the point $B$, and concave downwards from the point $B$ to the point $C$.

The point B , where the curve changes from being concave upwards to concave downwards, is called a point of inflection.

At a point of inflection, the tangent to the curve crosses the curve.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-112.jpg?height=279&width=401&top_left_y=1961&top_left_x=1228)

At a point of inflection, B , of a curve $y=f(x), \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=0$ and changes sign as the curve passes through B.

At a point of inflection, the slope of the tangent to the curve need not be zero as shown in the diagram on the previous page.

## Point of Inflection

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { At a point of inflection, } \mathrm{B} \text {, on the curve } y=f(x), \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=0 \text { and } \\
& \text { changes sign as the curve passes through } \mathrm{B} \text {. }
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, to find the point(s) of inflection of a curve:
(i) find $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$
(ii) solve the equation $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=0$
(iii) for each value of $x$, find the corresponding value of $y$.

Note: The point B on the given curve is a point of inflection. The tangent to the curve at B is also parallel to the $x$-axis.
The point B is called a saddle point or a horizontal point of inflection and is another example of a stationary point.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-113.jpg?height=341&width=534&top_left_y=1140&top_left_x=1098)

## Example 3

Find the point of inflection of the curve $y=x^{3}-3 x^{2}-2$.
$y=x^{3}-3 x^{2}-2$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=3 x^{2}-6 x \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=6 x-6$
$\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=0 \Rightarrow 6 x-6=0 \Rightarrow x=1$
When $x=1, y=(1)^{3}-3(1)^{2}-2=-4$
$\therefore(1,-4)$ is the point of inflection.

## Example 4

Verify that the curve $y=\frac{x+2}{2 x-3}$ has no turning points or points of inflection.
Verify also that the curve is decreasing for all values of $x \in R$.
To find the turning points, we solve the equation $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y=\frac{x+2}{2 x-3} \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{(2 x-3)(1)-(x+2)(2)}{(2 x-3)^{2}} \\
& =\frac{2 x-3-2 x-4}{(2 x-3)^{2}}=\frac{-7}{(2 x-3)^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The expression $\frac{-7}{(2 x-3)^{2}}$ can never be zero, as a fraction is zero only if

## the numerator is zero.

Since $\frac{-7}{(2 x-3)^{2}} \neq 0$, the curve has no turning points.
To find the point of inflection, we solve the equation $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=0$.
$\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{-7}{(2 x-3)^{2}}=-7(2 x-3)^{-2}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=14(2 x-3)^{-3}(2)=\frac{28}{(2 x-3)^{3}}$
Since $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=\frac{28}{(2 x-3)^{3}} \neq 0$, the curve has no point of inflection.
A curve is decreasing if $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ is negative.
$\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{-7}{(2 x-3)^{2}}$, which is always negative as $(2 x-3)^{2}$ is always positive.
$\Rightarrow$ The curve is decreasing for all $x \in R$.

## Section 4.3 Graphs of the derived (or slope) function

The curve on the right is the graph of the function

$$
y=x^{2}-2 x-3
$$

$\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ for this function is $2 x-2$.
$\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=2 x-2$ is the derived or slope function.
The blue line represents this slope function.
From the two graphs, the following can be observed:
(i) From A to B on the curve, the slope is negative. For this $x$-interval, the slope function (blue line) is also negative, i.e. the blue line is below the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-116.jpg?height=553&width=547&top_left_y=1282&top_left_x=1082) $x$-axis.
(ii) From B to C on the curve, the slope is positive.

For this $x$-interval, the slope function (blue line) is also positive, i.e. the blue line is above the $x$-axis.
(iii) The slope of the curve at the point B is zero, i.e. $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0$.

At the point $\mathrm{B}, x=1$.
Notice that the slope function is also zero at the point where $x=1$.
This illustrates that $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ (the slope function) is zero at a turning point.

## The slope function of a cubic function

The red curve on the right is the graph of a cubic function, $y=f(x)$.
The blue curve is the graph of its slope function, $y=g(x)$.
Some of the features of these curves are:
$>$ In the function $y=f(x)$, for $x<-3$, the slope is positive.
This is represented in the slope function $y=g(x)$, where $g(x)$ is positive for $x<-3$.
> From A to B , the slope of the curve is negative. That is, from $x>-3$ and $x<2$, the slope is negative.
It can be seen that the slope function is negative from $-3<x<2$.

> At $x=-3$ and $x=2$, the slope of the cubic function is zero.
At these two $x$-values, the slope function is also zero.
$>$ For $x>2$, the slope of the cubic function is positive.
For $x>2$, the slope function reflects this since it is also positive for $x>2$.

## Example 1

The graph of the function $y=f(x)$ is shown.
Use the graph to write down the range of values of $x$ for which
(i) $f^{\prime}(x)>0$
(ii) $f^{\prime}(x)<0$
(iii) $f^{\prime}(x)=0$.
(i) $f^{\prime}(x)$ represents the slope of the curve at any point.
$\therefore f^{\prime}(x)>0$ for $-1<x<5$

## Section 4.4 Maximum and minimum problems

In section 4.2, it was shown that differential calculus can be used in a very effective way to show that the maximum value of the given function is 10 , and that this occurs when $x=2$, as seen from the graph over.

In this section, we will show how differential calculus can also be used to maximise or minimise the value of any
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-121.jpg?height=296&width=416&top_left_y=1733&top_left_x=1216) function, such as $€ C$ to represent cost, Area ( $A$ ) to represent area, or $V$ to represent volume.

The solutions of the more basic problems involving maxima and minima will consist of the following steps:

1. Draw a diagram, where necessary, and mark on it the given dimensions.
2. Write down an expression in one variable for the quantity to be maximised or minimised. If the quantity is in two variables, use the given information to express one of the variables in terms of the other so that the quantity may then be expressed in terms of one variable.
3. Differentiate the function and equate it to zero.
4. Solve this equation to find the value(s) of $x$ at which the maximum or minimum value occurs.
5. Substitute this value for $x$ in the given equation to find the maximum or minimum value.
6. Use the second derivative test (i.e. $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} y}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$ ) to determine if the value(s) for $x$ gives a maximum or minimum value of the function.

## Example 1

A factory produces $n$ items per hour.
The overhead costs, $C(n)=€\left(400-16 n+\frac{n^{2}}{4}\right)$.
How many items should be produced to keep the overhead costs to a minimum?

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
C=€\left(400-16 n+\frac{n^{2}}{4}\right) & \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} C}{\mathrm{~d} n^{2}}=\frac{1}{2} \text { which is }>0 \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} C}{\mathrm{~d} n}=-16+\frac{n}{2} & \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} C}{\mathrm{~d} n}=0 & \Rightarrow-16+\frac{n}{2}=0 \\
& \Rightarrow n=32
\end{array}
$$

Since $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} C}{\mathrm{~d} n^{2}}>0, n=32$ is the number that should be produced to keep the overheads costs to a minimum.

## Example 2

A closed rectangular box is made of thin metal. The length of the box is three times its width. The volume of the box is $36 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ and its width is $x \mathrm{~cm}$.
Show that the surface area is $\left(6 x^{2}+\frac{96}{x}\right) \mathrm{cm}^{2}$.
Find the dimensions of the box with least surface area.
Volume $=36 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow & 3 x^{2} h=36 \\
\Rightarrow & x^{2} h=12 \\
\Rightarrow & h=\frac{12}{x^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-122.jpg?height=197&width=388&top_left_y=1971&top_left_x=862)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Surface area }=2(3 x h)+2(x h)+2\left(3 x^{2}\right) \\
&=6 x h+2 x h+6 x^{2} \\
&=8 x h+6 x^{2} \\
&=8 x\left(\frac{12}{x^{2}}\right)+6 x^{2}=\left(\frac{96}{x}+6 x^{2}\right) \mathrm{cm}^{2} \quad \ldots\left(h=\frac{12}{x^{2}}\right) \\
& \Rightarrow \text { Surface area }(S)=\left(6 x^{2}+\frac{96}{x}\right) \mathrm{cm}^{2} \\
& \frac{\mathrm{~d} S}{\mathrm{~d} x}=12 x-\frac{96}{x^{2}} \quad \ldots\left(\frac{96}{x}=96 x^{-1}\right) \\
& \frac{\mathrm{d} S}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0 \Rightarrow 12 x-\frac{96}{x^{2}}=0 \\
& \Rightarrow 12 x^{3}-96=0 \Rightarrow x^{3}=8 \Rightarrow x=2
\end{aligned}
$$

To investigate if this value of $x$ gives a maximum or a minimum value, we find $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} S}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} S}{\mathrm{~d} x}=12 x-\frac{96}{x^{2}} & =12 x-96 x^{-2} \\
\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} S}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}} & =12+192 x^{-3} \\
& =12+\frac{192}{x^{3}}=12+\frac{192}{8} \text { when } x=2 \\
& =36>0 \Rightarrow \text { minimum value }
\end{aligned}
$$

When $x=2$, the dimensions of the box are:

$$
\text { length }=3 x=6 ; \text { breadth }=x=2 ; \text { height }=\frac{12}{x^{2}}=3
$$

$\therefore$ The dimensions are 6 cm by 2 cm by 3 cm .

## Example 3

A rectangle is formed by using the positive $x$-axis and $y$-axis and a point $\mathrm{B}(x, y)$ on the line $2 x+y=6$, as shown.
(i) Find an expression for the area, $A$ square units, of this rectangle in terms of $x$.
(ii) What is the domain set of values of $x$ ?
(iii) Use differentiation to find the maximum possible area of this rectangle.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-123.jpg?height=539&width=347&top_left_y=1607&top_left_x=1194)
(i) Area $=$ length $\times$ breadth

$$
A=x(y)=x y
$$

We now express the area in terms of one variable.
Since $2 x+y=6 \Rightarrow y=6-2 x$
Area $(A)=x(6-2 x)=6 x-2 x^{2}$
(ii) Since the line intersects the $x$-axis at $(3,0) \Rightarrow 0<x<3$.
(iii) $A=6 x-2 x^{2}$
$\frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathrm{~d} x}=6-4 x$
$\Rightarrow 6-4 x=0 \Rightarrow x=1.5$... for a maximum or minimum to occur, $\frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0$
$\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} A}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=-4$, which is less than zero.
When $x=1.5$, a maximum occurs since $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} A}{\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}<0$.
Maximum area $=6(1.5)-2(1.5)^{2}=4.5$ square units.

## Example 4

A man wishes to get from a point A on one side of a river to a point C on the opposite side, as shown. The point C is 9 km from the point B which is 3 km directly across the river from A .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-124.jpg?height=265&width=588&top_left_y=1164&top_left_x=946)

The man can row at $4 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ and walk at $5 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$. If the man rows from A to D , and walks from D to C , find $|\mathrm{BD}|$ such that the man gets from A to C in the least possible time.

Let $|\mathrm{BD}|=x \mathrm{~km}$
$\Rightarrow|\mathrm{DC}|=(9-x) \mathrm{km}$
and $|\mathrm{AD}|=\sqrt{x^{2}+9} \mathrm{~km}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-124.jpg?height=265&width=609&top_left_y=1612&top_left_x=933)

Time taken to go from A to $\mathrm{D}=\frac{\sqrt{x^{2}+9}}{4}$ hours ... (Time $\left.=\frac{\text { Distance }}{\text { Speed }}\right)$
Time taken to go from D to $\mathrm{C}=\frac{9-x}{5}$ hours
$\Rightarrow$ Total time, $T=\left(\frac{\sqrt{x^{2}+9}}{4}+\frac{9-x}{5}\right)$ hours

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{4}\left(x^{2}+9\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}+\frac{1}{5}(9-x) \\
\frac{\mathrm{d} T}{\mathrm{~d} x} & =\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2 x}{\sqrt{x^{2}+9}}-\frac{1}{5} \\
& =\frac{x}{4 \sqrt{x^{2}+9}}-\frac{1}{5} \\
\frac{\mathrm{~d} T}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0 & \Rightarrow \frac{x}{4 \sqrt{x^{2}+9}}-\frac{1}{5}=0 \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{x}{4 \sqrt{x^{2}+9}}=\frac{1}{5} \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{x^{2}}{16\left(x^{2}+9\right)}=\frac{1}{25} \\
& \Rightarrow 25 x^{2}=16 x^{2}+144 \\
& \Rightarrow 9 x^{2}=144 \\
& \Rightarrow x^{2}=16 \Rightarrow x= \pm 4 \\
& \Rightarrow x=4 \mathrm{~km} \quad \ldots \text { disregard the negative answer } \\
& \Rightarrow|\mathrm{BD}|=4 \mathrm{~km}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 4.5 Rates of change

In our study of calculus so far, we have seen that $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$ represents the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$.
Similarly, if $V$ represents volume and $t$ represents time, then $\frac{\mathrm{d} V}{\mathrm{~d} t}$ is the rate of change of volume with respect to time.

It is clear that the process of differentiation may be used to tackle many kinds of problems involving rates of change.

One of the more important applications of the rate of change concerns the movement of a particle which starts at a fixed point O .
The displacement is defined as the change in position of the particle relative to O .
In this study of motion in a straight line, equations of the type $s=2 t^{2}-3 t+4$ occur frequently.
In this equation, $s$ represents the distance travelled (displacement) and $t$ represents time.
The rate of change of $s$ with respect to $t$ (i.e. velocity) is given by $\frac{\mathbf{d} \boldsymbol{s}}{\mathbf{d} \boldsymbol{t}}$.
Velocity may be positive, negative or zero.
If the velocity is positive, the particle is moving to the right.
If the velocity is negative, the direction of the motion is to the left.
A velocity of zero means the particle is instantaneously at rest.

The rate of change of velocity with respect to time is called the acceleration, $a$, of the object in motion.
$\therefore$ acceleration $(a)=\frac{\mathbf{d} \boldsymbol{v}}{\mathbf{d} t}$ or $\frac{\mathbf{d}^{2} \boldsymbol{s}}{\mathbf{d} \boldsymbol{t}^{2}}$.

If $s$ represents the distance travelled in time $t$, then
Speed and
(i) $\frac{\mathrm{d} s}{\mathrm{~d} t}$ is the velocity of the object at any given time

Acceleration
(ii) $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} s}{\mathrm{~d} t^{2}}$ represents the acceleration of the object.

Note: In the vast majority of the questions in the next exercise, 'velocity' and speed are interchangeable.

## Example 1

A body moves in a straight line so that its distance $s$, in metres, from a fixed point after $t$ secs is given by the equation

$$
s=10+27 t-t^{3}
$$

Find (i) the speed after 2 seconds
(ii) after how many seconds is the body at rest
(iii) the acceleration after 2 seconds.
(i) $s=10+27 t-t^{3}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Speed }=\frac{\mathrm{d} s}{\mathrm{~d} t} & =27-3 t^{2} \\
& =27-3(2)^{2} \\
& =15 \text { metres/sec, after } 2 \text { seconds }
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) If the body is at rest, the speed is zero.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} s}{\mathrm{~d} t}=0 & \Rightarrow 27-3 t^{2}=0 \\
& \Rightarrow 3 t^{2}=27 \Rightarrow t^{2}=9 \Rightarrow t=3 \tag{t>0}
\end{align*}
$$

$\therefore$ the body is at rest after 3 seconds
(iii) Acceleration is $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} s}{\mathrm{~d} t^{2}}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\mathrm{d} s}{\mathrm{~d} t}=27-3 t^{2} \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d}^{2} s}{\mathrm{~d} t^{2}}=-6 t \\
& \Rightarrow \text { acceleration }=-12 \text { metres } / \mathrm{sec}^{2}, \text { when } t=2
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: metres $/ \sec ^{2}$ represents "metres per second per second".

## Example 2

A marketing director of a company found that the revenue, $€ R$, from selling a fixed number of produced items at $€ P$ each is given by the formula

$$
R=30 P-2 P^{2}
$$

(i) Find $\frac{\mathrm{d} R}{\mathrm{~d} P}$ and explain what this means.
(ii) Calculate $\frac{\mathrm{d} R}{\mathrm{~d} P}$ when $P=10$.
(iii) For what selling prices is revenue rising?
(i) $R=30 P-2 P^{2}$
$\frac{\mathrm{d} R}{\mathrm{~d} P}=30-4 P$
$\frac{\mathrm{d} R}{\mathrm{~d} P}$ is the rate at which the revenue is changing relative to the price, $P$.
(ii) $\frac{\mathrm{d} R}{\mathrm{~d} P}=30-4 P=30-4(10)=-10$, when $P=10$
(iii) The revenue is rising when $\frac{\mathrm{d} R}{\mathrm{~d} P}$ is positive.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d} R}{\mathrm{~d} P}>0 \text { when } & 30-4 P>0 \\
30 & >4 P \\
4 P & <30 \\
P & <7.5
\end{aligned}
$$

For $P<€ 7.50$, the revenue increases as $P$ increases.

Note: In general, the phrase "the rate of change of ..." is taken to mean the rate of change with respect to time.
However, each question must be read carefully to identify the relevant variables and rates.

## Section 4.6 Related rates of change

In the previous section, we dealt with the use of the derivative as a measure of the rate of change of a function with respect to the variable.
If $A=\pi r^{2}$ represents the area of a circle of radius $r$, then $\frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathrm{~d} r}$ is the rate of change of the area with respect to $r$.

However, in practical cases, most rates of change are measured with respect to time. For example, if $V$ represents volume,
$\frac{\mathrm{d} V}{\mathrm{~d} t}$ is the rate of change of volume with respect to time.
In many situations, we are given one rate of change and asked to find another rate of change. In these situations, the Chain Rule is particularly useful when finding the required rate of change.
The Chain Rule states that $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} u} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} u}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.
This can be extended to $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} \bullet} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} \bullet}{\mathrm{~d} x}$, where $\bullet$ stands for any variable.
For example, $\frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathrm{~d} r}=\frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathbf{d} t} \cdot \frac{\mathbf{d} t}{\mathrm{~d} r}$

If we are given that $\frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathrm{~d} r}=8$, then $\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{~d} A}=\frac{1}{8}$.
Similarly, if $\frac{\mathrm{d} V}{\mathrm{~d} t}=6 \pi$, then $\frac{\mathrm{d} t}{\mathrm{~d} V}=\frac{1}{6 \pi}$.

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d} t}{\mathrm{~d} r}=\frac{1}{\frac{\mathrm{~d} r}{\mathrm{~d} t}}
$$

The method of solving problems involving 'related rates' is illustrated in the following examples.

## Example 1

The radius of a circle is increasing at the rate of $2 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{sec}$.
Find the rate at which the area is increasing when the radius is 3 cm .
We are given $\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{~d} t}=2$ and we require $\frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathrm{~d} t}$.

$$
\begin{array}{rl|r}
\frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathrm{~d} t} & =\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{~d} t} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} A}{\mathrm{~d} r} \\
& =2.2 \pi r \\
& =2.2 \pi(3) \quad \ldots r=3 \\
& =12 \pi & \begin{array}{r}
\text { To find } \frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathrm{~d} r}, \text { we us } \\
\text { formula } A=\pi r^{2}
\end{array} \\
\therefore \quad \frac{\mathrm{~d} A}{\mathrm{~d} t} & =12 \pi \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{sec}
\end{array} \quad \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} A}{\mathrm{~d} r}=2 \pi r
$$

When solving problems with related rates of change, these steps should prove useful.

1. Write down the rate you require, e.g. $\frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathrm{~d} t}$.
2. Write down the rate you are given, e.g. $\frac{\mathrm{d} r}{\mathrm{~d} t}$.
3. Use the Chain Rule to link these rates: $\frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathrm{~d} t}=\frac{\mathrm{d} A}{?} \cdot \frac{?}{\mathrm{~d} t}=\frac{\mathrm{d} A}{\mathrm{~d} r} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} r}{\mathrm{~d} t}$
4. Find an equation connecting the variables of the missing rate, i.e. $A=\pi r^{2}$.

## Example 2

The volume, $V \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, of water in a container is given by the expression $V=12 h^{2}$, where $h \mathrm{~cm}$ is the depth of the water.
Water is flowing into the container at a steady rate of $90 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \mathrm{sec}$.
Find the rate, in $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{sec}$, at which the depth of the water is increasing when $h=3$.

We require $\frac{\mathrm{d} h}{\mathrm{~d} t}$ and we are given $\frac{\mathrm{d} V}{\mathrm{~d} t}=90$.
Now, $\frac{\mathrm{d} h}{\mathrm{~d} t}=\frac{\mathrm{d} V}{\mathrm{~d} t} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} h}{\mathrm{~d} V}$
We need to find $\frac{\mathrm{d} h}{\mathrm{~d} V}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V=12 h^{2} \text { (given) } \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} V}{\mathrm{~d} h}=24 h \Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{~d} h}{\mathrm{~d} V}=\frac{1}{24 h} \\
& \frac{\mathrm{~d} h}{\mathrm{~d} t}=\frac{\mathrm{d} V}{\mathrm{~d} t} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~d} h}{\mathrm{~d} V} \\
& \quad=90 \times \frac{1}{24 h}=\frac{90}{24(3)}=\frac{90}{72}=\frac{5}{4} \text { when } h=3 \\
& \therefore \quad \frac{\mathrm{~d} h}{\mathrm{~d} t}=\frac{5}{4} \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{sec}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 5.1 Compound interest

When the interest earned by a sum of money on deposit in a bank is not withdrawn, it is added to the principal for the second year.

The interest grows year by year and is said to be compounded.

At a rate of 5\% per annum, the increase in the interest earned by $€ 10000$ can be seen year-onyear from the table.

| Year | Principal | Interest |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| One | $€ 10000$ | $€ 500$ |
| Two | $€ 10500$ | $€ 525$ |
| Three | $€ 11025$ | $€ 551$ |
| Four | $€ 11576$ | $€ 579$ |
| Five | $€ 12155$ | $€ 608$ |
|  | $€ 12763$ |  |

If the interest is withdrawn and not reinvested each year, a total of $5 \times € 500=€ 2500$ is earned.
Compounding the interest, a total of $€ 2763$ is earned.
Generally, if $i$ (per cent, expressed as a decimal) is the interest rate, then $i \times \mathrm{P}$ is the interest earned, where $€ \mathrm{P}$ is the principal or investment at the beginning of the year.
At the start of the second year, there is $\mathrm{P}+i \mathrm{P}=\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{1}+\boldsymbol{i})^{\mathbf{1}}$ on deposit in the bank.
The change in the principal, year-by-year, can be seen from the following table:

| Year (end) | Principal | Interest |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | P | $i \times \mathrm{P}$ |
| one | $\mathbf{P}+i \mathbf{P}=\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{1}+i)^{\mathbf{1}}$ | $i \times \mathrm{P}(1+i)$ |
| two | $\mathrm{P}(1+i)+i \mathrm{P}(1+i)=\mathrm{P}(1+i)(1+i)=\mathbf{P}(1+i)^{2}$ | $i \times \mathrm{P}(1+i)^{2}$ |
| three | $\mathbf{P}(1+i)^{2}+i \mathbf{P}(1+i)^{2}=\mathbf{P}(1+i)^{2}(1+i)=\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{1}+i)^{\mathbf{3}}$ |  |
| year $t$ | $=\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{1}+\boldsymbol{i})^{\boldsymbol{t}}$ |  |

At the end of year $t$, there is $\boldsymbol{€} \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{1}+\boldsymbol{i})^{\boldsymbol{t}}$ on deposit.
For example, $€ 10000$, invested for 5 years at $5 \%$ compounded annually, amounts to $€ 10000(1+0.05)^{5}=€ 12,763 . \therefore \quad$ the interest gained $=€ 2763$.

APR ("Annual Percentage Rate") is the "true" annual rate of interest charged for borrowing money.

AER ("Annual Equivalent Rate") is the rate of interest paid on investments.

## 1. Final value

If the interest is fixed for a period of time $t$, then the principal $€ \mathrm{P}$ added to the compound interest is called the final value of €P.

The final value of a sum of money $€ \mathrm{P}$, invested now at $i \%$ for $t$ years, is

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { Final value }(\mathbf{F})=€ \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{1}+\boldsymbol{i})^{\boldsymbol{t}} \\
\text { Interest earned }=€ \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{1}+\boldsymbol{i})^{\boldsymbol{t}}-€ \mathbf{P}
\end{gathered}
$$

Find the final value of $€ 5000$ invested at $4 \%$ (AER) per annum, compounded annually, for 6 years. Find also the interest earned over the period.

Future value $=€ \mathrm{P}(1+i)^{t}=€ 5000(1+0.04)^{6}=€ 6326.60$
Interest earned $=€ 6326.60-€ 5000=€ 1326.60$

## Example 2

An investment bond offers a return of $15 \%$ if invested for 4 years.
Calculate the AER (annual equivalent rate) for this bond, as a percentage, correct to two places of decimals.

A return of $15 \%$ after 4 years means that the amount (future value) is 1.15 times the sum invested, €P.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad € P(1+i)^{4}=€ P(1.15) \\
& \therefore \quad(1+i)^{4}=1.15 \\
& (1+i)=1.15^{\frac{1}{4}}=1.03555 \ldots \text { taking the fourth root of both sides } \\
& \begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad i(\text { annual equivalent rate }) & =.03555=3.555 \% \\
& =3.56 \%
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

It is now common practice to have interest "added monthly" to a savings account. In this case a monthly interest rate is applied that is equivalent to the annual rate.

If $r$ is the monthly rate and $i=5 \%$ is the annual equivalent rate (AER), then for 12 payments

$$
\begin{aligned}
& (1+r)^{12}=(1+i)=(1+0.05)=1.05 \\
& \therefore \quad(1+r)=(1.05)^{\frac{1}{12}}=1.004074 \\
& \therefore \quad r=1.004074-1=0.004074=0.4074 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore 5 \%$ per year is equivalent to $0.4074 \%$ per month.
Note: $i$ is always expressed as a decimal, e.g. $5 \%=0.05$

To calculate monthly interest rates, $r \%$ :

$$
(1+r)^{12}=(1+i) \quad r \% \text { per month, } i \% \text { per year }
$$

## Example 3

$€ 5000$ is invested at $4 \% \mathrm{AER}$. If the interest is added monthly, find the final value of this investment after (i) $3 \frac{1}{2}$ years (ii) 5 years 2 months.

The monthly effective rate $r$ is found by solving the equation $(1+r)^{12}=1.04$.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & (1+r)=1.04^{\frac{1}{12}}=1.003274 \\
\therefore & r=0.003274=0.3274 \% \text { per month. }
\end{array}
$$

The final value after
(i) $3 \frac{1}{2}$ years $=3 \frac{1}{2} \times 12=42$ months

$$
\Rightarrow F=5000(1.003274)^{42}=€ 5735.77
$$

(ii) 5 years 2 months $=62$ months

$$
\Rightarrow F=5000(1.003274)^{62}=€ 6123.26 .
$$

## 2. Present value

To find the present value of $€ 10000$ due in three years time, we must calculate what sum of money, invested at $i \% ~($ e.g. $5 \%=0.05)$ compounded annually, would have a final value of $€ 10000$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Final value }=\text { Present value } \times(1+i)^{t} \\
& \Rightarrow \text { Present value }=\frac{\text { Future value }}{(1+i)^{t}} \\
& \Rightarrow \text { Present value }=\frac{10000}{(1.05)^{3}}=€ 8638.38
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\text { Present value }=\frac{\text { Final value }}{(1+i)^{t}}
$$

Therefore, at an annual equivalent rate of $5 \%$, the present value of $€ 10000$ (in 3 years time) is €8638.38.

## Example 4

The local GAA club runs a draw.
You win first prize and you are offered
(a) $€ 15000$ now or
(b) $€ 18000$ in four years time.

When calculating present value, the rate $i \%$ is often referred to as the "discount rate".

Which prize should you choose to have the greatest value? Assume a discount rate of $4 \%$.

The present value of $€ 18000$ based on a discount rate of $4 \%$ is

$$
\text { Present value }=\frac{\text { Final value }}{(1+i)^{t}}=\frac{18000}{(1.04)^{3}}=€ 15386.48
$$

Therefore, the best value prize, based on a discount rate of $4 \%$, is option (b) $€ 18000$ in four years time.

## Summary

| Final value: $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{t}$ | Present value: $\mathrm{P}=\frac{\mathrm{F}}{(1+i)^{t}}$ |
| :--- | :--- |

## Example 5

In how many years would $€ 5000$ increase in value to $€ 6500$ if invested at an AER of $3.5 \%$ ?

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{t} \\
\therefore \quad € 6500=€ 5000(1.035)^{t}
\end{gathered}
$$

Method 1 (Logs)(See chapter 12 book 4)
$\Rightarrow \quad(1.035)^{t}=\frac{€ 6500}{€ 5000}=1.3$
$\Rightarrow \boldsymbol{\operatorname { l n }}(1.035)^{t}=\boldsymbol{\operatorname { l n }} 1.3 \ldots$ taking the $\log$ of both sides
$\Rightarrow \quad t \ln (1.035)=\ln 1.3 \ldots \ln \mathrm{~A}^{n}=n \ln \mathrm{~A}$
$\Rightarrow t=\frac{\ln 1.3}{\ln (1.035)}=7.63$ years

Method 2 (Calculator)
$\Rightarrow \quad(1.035)^{t}=1.3$
$\Rightarrow t=\log _{1.035}(1.3)=7.63 \ldots$
using the logal key on the calculator.

## Section 5.2 Depreciation

In the previous section, money lodged into a savings account appreciated in value.
The final value was greater than the present value.
Depreciation occurs when the final value of an asset is less than the present value.
Cars, computers and household appliances generally depreciate in value over time.
Houses in Ireland appreciated in value up to 2007 but have since greatly depreciated in value relative to this "peak" value. Two types of depreciation can be considered.

1. Straight line depreciation occurs when the value of an object reduces by a constant amount each year.
For example, take a car costing $€ 20000$ that loses $10 \%$ of its original value each year.
This car loses €2000 in value each year and so the car has no value after 10 years.
2. Reducing balance depreciation occurs when the value of an object reduces by a fixed percentage of its value each year.
Consider a car costing €20000 that loses $10 \%$ of its value each year on a reducing balance.
The value of the car after 10 years $=€ 20000(1-0.1)^{10}=€ 6973.57$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-150.jpg?height=696&width=989&top_left_y=1446&top_left_x=451)
(Note: Our course emphasises the reducing balance method for calculating depreciation.)

Similar to compound interest when $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{t}$, the final value of an item based on a reducing balance is given by the formula $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{1}-\boldsymbol{i})^{\boldsymbol{t}}$.

```
F = final value
Depreciation: F= P(1-i)t}\quadi=\mathrm{ the percentage depreciation of €P per year
    t= number of years
    P = initial value
```


## Example 1

A company buys a new machine priced at $€ 35000$.
The machine depreciates by $20 \%$ on a reducing balance basis each year.
(i) What will the value of the machine be in 4 years time?
(ii) By how much has the machine depreciated in value during this time?
(i) Final value: $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{P}(1-i)^{t}=€ 35000 \times(1-0.2)^{4}$ $=€ 35000 \times(0.8)^{4}=€ 14336$.
(ii) Depreciation $=€ 35000-€ 14336=€ 20664$.

## Example 2

A garage has a petrol stock of 100000 litres.
If the manager estimates (a) that he will sell 4000 litres a day
(b) that he will sell $5 \%$ of his stock per day, calculate the difference in his estimates after 20 days.

After 20 days: $4000 \times 20=80000$ litres sold

$$
\Rightarrow 100000-80000=20000 \text { litres left. }
$$

After 20 days the future (depleted) stock, $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{P}(1-i)^{t}$

$$
=100000(1-0.05)^{20}=35849 \text { litres }
$$

Therefore the difference in his estimates is 15849 litres.

## Exercise 5.2

(In the following exercise, depreciation is used on a reducing balance basis unless otherwise stated.)

## Section 5.3 Instalment savings (annuities)

## 1. Instalment saving

If a constant amount of money is saved each month for 3 years in total, then each instalment earns different (compound) interest, since it is invested for a different length of time. The first instalment is in the bank for 3 years = 36 months ; the last instalment is in the bank for only one month.
Let $€ \mathrm{P}$ be invested at the beginning of each month for 3 years at a monthly rate of $i \%$.
The first payment has a value of $\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{36}$ after 36 months.
The second payment has a value of $\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{35}$ after 35 months, etc $\ldots$
The total value of the investment is the sum of these 36 individual amounts.
This sum is calculated as follows:

$$
\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{36}+\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{35}+\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{34}+\ldots \ldots . \mathrm{P}(1+i)^{2}+\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{1}
$$

If we reverse the order, we get

$$
\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{1}+\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{2}+\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{3} \ldots \ldots+\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{35}+\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{36}
$$

which is the sum of the geometric series where
the first term, the common ratio, the number of terms,

$$
\left.\begin{array}{rl}
a & =\mathrm{P}(1+i)^{1} \\
r & =(1+i) \\
n & =36
\end{array}\right\}
$$

Using the formula for the sum of $n$ terms of a geometric sequence, $S_{n}=\frac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{(1-r)}$, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { final value }=\frac{\mathrm{P}(1+i)\left[1-(1+i)^{36}\right]}{1-(1+i)}= & \frac{\mathrm{P}(1+i)\left[1-(1+i)^{36}\right]}{-i} \\
& =\frac{\mathrm{P}(1+i)\left[(1+i)^{36}-1\right]}{i}
\end{aligned}
$$

In general, the Final value, $\mathbf{F}$, of instalment savings over $\boldsymbol{t}$ instalments is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{F}=€ \mathrm{P}(1+i)^{1} & +€ \mathrm{P}(1+i)^{2}+€ \mathrm{P}(1+i)^{3}+\ldots . € \mathrm{P}(1+i)^{t}=\frac{€ \mathbf{P}(1+i)\left[(1+i)^{t}-1\right]}{i} \\
€ \mathrm{P} & =\text { the amount saved at the start of each month/year } \\
t & =\text { the number of payments (months/years) } \\
i & =\text { the interest rate, expressed as a decimal }
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-154.jpg?height=588&width=1085&top_left_y=1427&top_left_x=377)

For example, if I save $€ 25$ every year for 3 years, the accumulated total (final value) of my savings would be $€ 89.13$ at the end of the third year.

## Example 1

Catríona saves $€ 400$ every three months for five years at an effective quarterly rate of $0.9 \%$.
(i) Represent her savings by a geometric series
(ii) Find the value of her investment at the end of the period.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& i=0.9 \%=0.009 \\
& 5 \text { years }=(5 \times 4) \text { quarters }=20 \text { payments }
\end{aligned}
$$

(i) Catríona's savings are represented by

$$
400(1.009)+400(1.009)^{2}+400(1.009)^{3}+\ldots+400(1.009)^{20}
$$

(ii) $\left.\begin{array}{rl}a & =400(1.009) \\ r & =(1+i)=1.009 \\ n & =20\end{array}\right\} \begin{aligned} & S_{n}=\frac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{(1-r)} \\ & S_{n}=\frac{400(1.009)\left[1-(1.009)^{20}\right]}{1-1.009}\end{aligned}$
= €8800.89

Note: In all calculations, the rate " $i$ " is converted from a percentage to a decimal.
E.g. $i=5 \%=0.05$.

## Example 2

Find the sum of money, $€ \mathrm{P}$, that needs to be saved per month to cover the cost of a $€ 1500$ holiday in 18 months time. The interest rate on offer is $0.4 \%$ per month.

The final value (FV) needed $=€ 1500$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \quad \mathrm{F}=€ \mathrm{P}(1+i)+€ \mathrm{P}(1+i)^{2} \ldots \ldots=\frac{€ \mathrm{P}(1+i)\left[(1+i)^{n}-1\right]}{i} \\
& \left.\begin{array}{rl}
i= & 0.4 \% \\
n= & 18
\end{array}\right\} 1+i=1.004 \\
& \therefore \quad \mathrm{FV}=€ 1500=€ \mathrm{P}(1.004)+€ \mathrm{P}(1.004)^{2} \ldots \ldots € \mathrm{P}(1.004)^{18} \\
& \therefore \quad € 1500=\frac{€ \mathrm{P}(1.004)\left[(1.004)^{18}-1\right]}{0.004}=\frac{€ \mathrm{P} \times 0.0748}{0.004}=€ \mathrm{P} \times 18.70 \\
& \therefore \quad \mathrm{P}=€ 1500 \div 18.7 \\
& \quad=€ 80.21 \text { per month }
\end{aligned}
$$

## 2. Pensions

Similar to instalment savings, we can calculate the sum of money needed to be invested now to guarantee a fixed pension payable over a number of years.
For example, if I want a pension of €P per year for the next 20 years, I will need to calculate the present value of each of the payments, $€ \mathrm{P}$, I will receive.
The total of these "present value" amounts is the sum of money that needs to be invested.
The sum of $€ \mathrm{P}$, paid to you at the end of the first year, has a present value now of $\frac{€ \mathrm{P}}{(1+i)}$.
The sum of $€ \mathrm{P}$, paid at the end of the second year, has a present value now of $\frac{€ \mathrm{P}}{(1+i)^{2}}$.
The sum to be invested is obtained by summing all these amounts.

$$
\frac{€ \mathrm{P}}{(1+i)}+\frac{€ \mathrm{P}}{(1+i)^{2}}+\frac{€ \mathrm{P}}{(1+i)^{3}}+\ldots+\frac{€ \mathrm{P}}{(1+i)^{20}}
$$

This is the sum of a geometric series containing 20 terms, where

$$
\therefore \quad S_{n}=\frac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{(1-r)}=\frac{\mathrm{P}}{(1+i)} \times \frac{\left(1-\left(\frac{1}{1+i}\right)^{20}\right)}{\left(1-\left(\frac{1}{1+i}\right)\right)}
$$

$$
\left\{\begin{aligned}
a & =\frac{€ \mathrm{P}}{(1+i)} \\
r & =\frac{1}{(1+i)} \\
n & =20
\end{aligned}\right.
$$

In general, the Present value (cost), $\mathbf{P V}$, of a pension fund is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{PV} & =\frac{€ \mathrm{P}}{(1+i)}+\frac{€ \mathrm{P}}{(1+i)^{2}}+\frac{€ \mathrm{P}}{(1+i)^{3}}+\ldots \ldots \frac{€ \mathrm{P}}{(1+i)^{t}}=\frac{\mathrm{P}}{(1+i)} \times \frac{\left(1-\left(\frac{1}{1+i}\right)^{t}\right)}{\left(1-\left(\frac{1}{1+i}\right)\right)} \\
€ \mathrm{P} & =\text { yearly pension } \\
n & =\text { number of years (lifetime of pension) } \\
i & =\text { fixed rate of interest over the term } \\
& \text { of the pension }
\end{aligned} \quad=\frac{\mathrm{P}}{(1+i)^{t}}\left(\frac{(1+i)^{t}-1}{i}\right){ }^{i} \text { ) }
$$

Note: Most pensions operate on a guaranteed rate of interest.
However, some may depend on market performance and gain or lose compared to the fixed (guaranteed) rate.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-156.jpg?height=428&width=1024&top_left_y=1743&top_left_x=407)

That is, if I want a pension of € 25 every year for 3 years, I need to invest € 63.82 now.

## Example 3

What amount of money is needed now to provide a pension of $€ 25000$ a year for 20 years, assuming an AER of $4 \%$ ?

$$
i=4 \%=0.04 \Rightarrow 1+i=1.04
$$

The amount required, or present value $(\mathrm{P})$ of this pension, is represented by the geometric series:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left.\begin{array}{rl}
\mathrm{P}=\frac{25000}{1.04}+\frac{25000}{(1.04)^{2}}+\frac{25000}{(1.04)^{3}}+\ldots \ldots \frac{25000}{(1.04)^{20}} \\
\begin{array}{rl}
a=\frac{€ 25000}{(1.04)} \\
n=20
\end{array} \\
r=\frac{1}{1+i}=\frac{1}{1.04}
\end{array}\right\} \begin{aligned}
S_{n}=\frac{a\left(1-r^{n}\right)}{(1-r)} & =\frac{25000}{(1.04)} \times \frac{\left(1-\left(\frac{1}{1.04}\right)^{20}\right)}{\left(1-\left(\frac{1}{1.04}\right)\right)} \\
& =€ 339758.16
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, a pension fund of $€ 339758.16$ invested now will provide 20 yearly payments of €25 000 .

Note 1: In answering questions on instalment savings and pensions it is best practice to set up the geometric series underpinning each question.
It is important to identify the first term, the common ratio and the number of terms in the series for each particular question.

Note 2: It is also important to have a clear understanding of the time-line of series i.e when the first/last payment is to be made/received.

## Example 4

Calculate the final value of an instalment savings plan based on saving €600 at the start of each year @ 4\% per annum for 5 years.
(i) Calculate the present value of these payments.
(ii) Hence show that if the present value was put on deposit at the same rate for the same length of time, it would have the same final value.

Savings plan: $F V=600(1.04)+600(1.04)^{2}+600(1.04)^{3}+600(1.04)^{4}+600(1.04)^{5}$

$$
=€ 600(1.04)\left(\frac{(1.04)^{5}-1}{0.04}\right)=€ 3379.79 \text { (at the end of } 5 \text { years) }
$$

(i) Present value $(P V)=€ 600+\frac{€ 600}{(1.04)^{1}}+\frac{€ 600}{(1.04)^{2}}+\frac{€ 600}{(1.04)^{3}}+\frac{€ 600}{(1.04)^{4}}$

$$
\begin{aligned}

(ii) Calculate the future value of the annuity.
(iii) If the present value of the annuity in (i) was put on deposit as a single investment at $8 \%$ per annum, show that it will amount to the same future value of the annuity after 6 years.

## Section 5.4 Loans - Mortgages

If we wish to calculate the repayments needed for a car loan or a mortgage on a house, we use the same procedure for finding the present value as was used in the previous section.

The sum of the present values of each repayment over the given period of time must be equal to the value of the car loan or mortgage.
(formulae and tables, p.31)

## Example 1

Calculate the size of the monthly repayments needed for a car loan of $€ 10000$ if the loan is to be repaid over a 5 -year term at an effective monthly rate of $0.72 \%$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& i=0.72 \%=0.0072 \Rightarrow 1+i=1.0072 \\
& n=5 \times 12=60 \text { repayments } \\
& \begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad € \mathrm{~A}(\text { Repayment }) & =€ P(\text { Loan }) \frac{(i)(1+i)^{t}}{(1+i)^{t}-1}=\frac{€ 10000(0.0072)(1.0072)^{60}}{(1.0072)^{60}-1} \\
& \quad=€ 206 \ldots \text { correct to the nearest euro }
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: When using the mortgage/loan formula, each (re)payment is paid at the end of each accounting period, i.e. at the end of a month or at the end of a year.

## Example 2

Find the monthly repayments required for a mortgage of $€ 150000$, based on an annual rate of $4.5 \%$ over 20 years.

We first find the effective monthly rate:
$(1+r)^{12}=(1+i)$, where $r \%=$ rate per month and $i \%=$ rate per year.
$\Rightarrow(1+r)^{12}=1.045$
$\Rightarrow(1+r)=(1.045)^{\frac{1}{12}}=1.00367$
$\Rightarrow r=0.00367$ per month $=0.367 \%$ per month
$n=20 \times 12=240$ payments
$\therefore € \mathrm{~A}=€ P \frac{(i)(1+i)^{t}}{(1+i)^{t}-1}=\frac{€ 150000(0.00367)(1.00367)^{240}}{(1.00367)^{240}-1}=€ 941.22$
Therefore the monthly repayment is $€ 941.22$.

## 1. Trapezium

A trapezium is a quadrilateral which has one pair of parallel sides.
The area of a trapezium $=a h_{\text {parallelogram }}+\frac{1}{2}(b-a) h_{\text {triangle }}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
= & a h+\frac{1}{2} b h-\frac{1}{2} a h \\
= & \frac{1}{2} a h+\frac{1}{2} b h=\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) h \\
= & \text { half the sum of the lengths of the } \\
& \text { parallel sides times the height. }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 1

If a parallelogram has a base of 10 cm , and a trapezium of the same area and height has a base of 14 cm , find $x$, the length of the other parallel side of the trapezium.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-168.jpg?height=225&width=661&top_left_y=1472&top_left_x=869)

Area of parallelogram $=$ Base $\times$ perpendicular height $(h)=10 h$
Area of trapezium $=\frac{1}{2}(x+14) \times$ perpendicular height $(h)=\frac{1}{2}(x+14) h$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore & & 10 h & =\frac{1}{2}(x+14) h \\
\Rightarrow & & 20 & =x+14 \\
\Rightarrow & x & =6 \quad \Rightarrow & \text { the other parallel side }=6 \mathrm{~cm}

## 2. Polygons

A polygon is a plane (2-dimensional) shape with straight edges.
Regular polygons are symmetrical, with a base triangle repeated in polygons with more than 4 sides. The interior angles of regular polygons are:
Triangle $=60^{\circ}$, Quadrilateral $=90^{\circ}$, Pentagon $=108^{\circ}$, Hexagon $=120^{\circ}$, Heptagon $=128.6^{\circ}$

## Example 2

The area of the regular pentagon shown here is $600 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.
Calculate the length of one side, $x$, of the pentagon.
Since the total angle at the centre of the pentagon $=360^{\circ}$,
$\therefore \quad$ each angle at the centre $=\frac{360^{\circ}}{5}=72^{\circ}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-169.jpg?height=267&width=303&top_left_y=1064&top_left_x=1230)

Each triangle is congruent and has equal base angles $=\frac{(180-72)^{\circ}}{2}=54^{\circ}$
Each triangle has an area of $\left(\frac{600}{5}\right) \mathrm{cm}^{2}=120 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.
$\operatorname{Tan} 54^{\circ}=\frac{h}{\frac{x}{2}} \Rightarrow h=\frac{x}{2} \tan 54^{\circ}$

The area of the triangle $=\frac{1}{2} \times$ base $\times h=\frac{1}{2} \times x \times h=120 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

$$
=\frac{1}{2} \times x \times \frac{x}{2} \tan 54^{\circ}=120 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}
$$

$\Rightarrow \quad x^{2}=\frac{480}{\tan 54^{\circ}}=348.74 \Rightarrow x=18.675=18.7 \mathrm{~cm}$

## Section 6.2 Sectors of circles

1. Revision of circles and sectors of circles

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

2. Arc of a circle

In the chapter on trigonometry, the length of an arc, the area of a sector, and radian measure were introduced. The length of an arc of a circle is found using the ratios

$$
\frac{\ell}{2 \pi r}=\frac{\theta(\text { degrees })}{360}=\frac{\theta(\text { radians })}{2 \pi}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-172.jpg?height=390&width=529&top_left_y=1870&top_left_x=1105)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore \text { Length of } \operatorname{arc}(l)=2 \pi r \frac{\theta(\text { degrees })}{360} & =2 \pi r \frac{\theta(\text { radians })}{2 \pi} \\
= & r \theta(\theta \text { in radians })
\end{aligned}
$$

## 3. Area of a sector

Similarly, the area of a sector of a circle is found using the ratios

$$
\frac{A}{\pi r^{2}}=\frac{\theta(\text { degrees })}{360}=\frac{\theta(\text { radians })}{2 \pi}
$$

$\therefore$ Area of sector $(A)=\pi r^{2} \frac{\theta(\text { degrees })}{360}=\pi r^{2} \frac{\theta(\text { radians })}{2 \pi}=\frac{1}{2} r^{2} \theta(\theta$ in radians $)$

## Example 1

A flowerbed in the shape of a section of a sector of a circle is placed in the centre of a rectangular lawn, as shown in the diagram. Calculate
(i) the length of edging needed for the flowerbed
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-173.jpg?height=272&width=522&top_left_y=1071&top_left_x=1012)
(ii) the area of grass in the garden.

Correct each answer to one place of decimals.
(i) length of large arc $\mathrm{IH}=2 \pi r \frac{\theta(\text { degrees })}{360}=\left(\frac{90}{360} 2 \pi 8\right) \mathrm{m}=4 \pi \mathrm{~m}$

$$
\begin{array}{l|r}
\text { length of small arc JK }=\left(\frac{90}{360} 2 \pi 3\right) \mathrm{m} & \begin{array}{r}
\text { Total perimeter }= \\
4 \pi+\frac{3 \pi}{2}+(2 \times 5)=\left(\frac{11 \pi}{2}+10\right) \mathrm{m} \\
=\frac{3 \pi}{2} \mathrm{~m}
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$

(ii) The area of the sector (flowerbed portion) $=$

Area of large sector - Area of small sector

$$
=\left(\frac{90}{360}\right) \pi 8^{2} \mathrm{~m}^{2}-\left(\frac{90}{360}\right) \pi 3^{2} \mathrm{~m}^{2}=\left(\frac{90}{360}\right) 55 \pi \mathrm{~m}^{2}=43.197 \mathrm{~m}^{2}
$$

Area of rectangle $=(8 \times 16) \mathrm{m}^{2}=128 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$
$\therefore \quad$ The area of grass $=(128-43.197) \mathrm{m}^{2}=84.8 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$

## Example 2

A minor arc CD of a circle, centre O and radius 20 cm , subtends an angle $x$ radians at O . The major arc CD of the circle subtends an angle $5 x$ radians at O .
Find, in terms of $\pi$, the length of the minor arc.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x+5 x & =2 \pi \\
x & =\frac{2 \pi}{6}=\frac{\pi}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

The length of the minor $\operatorname{arc}=r \theta=20 x=\frac{20 \pi}{3} \mathrm{~cm}$
(Note: This is an exact measurement. An approximate answer
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-174.jpg?height=312&width=298&top_left_y=379&top_left_x=1254) is obtained when we substitute a value for $\pi$.)

## Section 6.3 3-Dimensional objects

## 1. Prisms

A prism is a three-dimensional figure that has the same cross-section all along its length.
Shown here is a prism with an equilateral triangular end.
The volume $=(\mathrm{A} \times l) \mathrm{m}^{3}$
The external surface area $=[2 \mathrm{~A}+3(l \times b)] \mathrm{m}^{2}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-177.jpg?height=298&width=531&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=1097)

A rubbish skip is also a prism where the base is in the shape of a trapezium.
Given that the width and perpendicular height of this skip are both 1.8 m ,
the volume $\mathrm{V}=$ Area $_{\text {trapezium }} \times 1.8 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\left(\frac{3.5+2.3}{2}\right) \times 1.8 \times 1.8 \mathrm{~m}^{3} \\
& =9.369 \mathrm{~m}^{3}=9.4 \mathrm{~m}^{3} .
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-177.jpg?height=352&width=503&top_left_y=616&top_left_x=1125)

The surface area of a prism is best obtained by expanding the net of the prism.

The slant height is $\sqrt{0.6^{2}+1.8^{2}}=1.9 \mathrm{~m}$
The area of each end $(\mathrm{E})=(1.8 \times 1.9) \mathrm{m}^{2}$
This skip has an external surface area of:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Area } & =2\left(\frac{3.5+2.3}{2}\right) \times 1.8+1.8 \times 2.3+2(1.8 \times 1.9) \\
& =21.42 \mathrm{~m}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: a prism can have many differently shaped (polygonal) bases.
Generally, the volume of a prism $=($ area of the base $) \times($ length $) l$

## 3. Percentage Error / Tolerance / Degrees of accuracy

(i) Percentage error

During an experiment John estimated the volume of a liquid to be 100 ml .

He then measured it and found it to have a volume of 125 ml .

His percentage error is as shown.
(ii) Tolerance

If a measurement is taken against a scale e.g. (i) a ruler measuring length in mm (ii) a balance measuring mass(weight) in $g$
(iii) a clock measuring time in $s$. the accuracy of that measurement is limited by the size of the smallest unit on the scale.
The tolerance of that measurement is always $\pm \frac{1}{2}$ (the basic unit on the scale)

We say that the measurement is take to within $\pm 0.5$ of the basic unit.

If the measurement is the area or volume, each dimension will have a similar tolerance.

| Estimated volume: | 100 ml |
| :--- | :--- |
| True volume: | 125 ml |
| Error: | 25 ml |
| Relative error: | $\frac{25}{125}=\frac{1}{5}=0.2$ |
| Percentage error: | $\frac{25}{125} \times \frac{100}{1}=20 \%$ |

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-179.jpg?height=251&width=668&top_left_y=667&top_left_x=925)

Reading A is $24 \pm 0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$
Reading B is $27.5 \pm 0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-179.jpg?height=319&width=392&top_left_y=1118&top_left_x=1240)
(iii) Degrees of accuracy

When a measurement is calculated to a given degree of accuracy e.g. correct to 1 place of decimals, an error on the measurement is created.
E.g. If a length is calculated as 10.3 cm , corrected to 1 place of decimals, this implies a minimum possible length of 10.25 cm and a maximum possible length of 10.34999....cm.

The actual length is within the range $10.25 \mathrm{~cm} \leq$ length $<10.34999 \ldots \mathrm{~cm}$

## Example 1

Find the volume of the truncated cone shown (a frustum) correct to 1 place of decimals.
By drawing the cross-section through the centre of the truncated cone, we can see that by subtracting the smaller cone on the top from
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-179.jpg?height=243&width=427&top_left_y=1854&top_left_x=1083) the larger cone, the remainder is the volume of the frustrum.

From similar triangles we have,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{h-8}{4} & =\frac{h}{6} \Rightarrow 6 h-48=4 \mathrm{~h} \\
2 h & =48 \\
h & =24
\end{aligned}
$$

Volume of larger cone $=\frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h=\frac{1}{3} \pi \times 6^{2} \times 24=288 \pi$
The height of the smaller cone $\mid \mathrm{PCl}=h-8=16 \mathrm{~cm}$
$\therefore \quad$ Volume of smaller cone $=\frac{1}{3} \pi r^{2} h=\frac{1}{3} \pi \times 4^{2} \times 16=\frac{256}{3} \pi$
$\therefore$ Volume of frustum $=288 \pi-\frac{256}{3} \pi=\frac{608}{3} \pi=636.7 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

## Example 2

Mat weighed 85 kg before training and 81 kg after. He took both measurements on a scales measuring in kg .
Find the minimum and maximum values for his weight loss.
The tolerance of his scales is $\pm 0.5 \mathrm{~kg}$
$\therefore$ before training his minimum weight was 84.5 kg and his maximum weight was 85.5 kg

After training his minimum weight was 80.5 kg and his maximum weight was 81.5 kg
$\therefore \quad$ the maximum weight loss was $(85.5-80.5) \mathrm{kg}=5 \mathrm{~kg}$
the minimum weight loss was $(84.5-81.5) \mathrm{kg}=3 \mathrm{~kg}$
Note: the tolerance interval for his weight loss was $4 \pm 1 \mathrm{~kg}$

## Example 3

A company makes ball bearings (spheres) for a machine with a diameter of 12 mm . They claim that they are produced to an accuracy of $\pm 0.02 \mathrm{~mm}$.
Find the largest and smallest ball bearing volumes produced.
Find the percentage error on (i) the diameter (ii) the volume.
Diameter $=12 \mathrm{~mm} \Rightarrow$ Diameter $_{\text {max }}=12.02 \mathrm{~mm}$, Diameter $_{\text {min }}=11.98 \mathrm{~mm}$
Volume $=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3} \Rightarrow$ Volume $\max =\frac{4}{3} \pi(6.01)^{3}=909.310 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$
$\Rightarrow$ Volume $\min =\frac{4}{3} \pi(5.99)^{3}=900.262 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$
(i) \% error on the diameter $=\frac{0.02}{12} \times 100 \%= \pm 0.167 \%$
(ii) Volume $=\frac{4}{3} \pi(6)^{3}=904.779 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$
$\Rightarrow \%$ error on the volume $=\frac{909.310-904.779}{904.779} \times 100 \%= \pm 0.5 \%$

## Section 6.4 Trapezoidal rule for calculating area

To calculate the areas of shapes with irregular boundaries, e.g. fields, lakes, etc., surveyors have usually divided the area into a series of parallel strips, each in the shape of a trapezium; a quadrilateral with two of the four sides parallel to each other.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-185.jpg?height=510&width=1125&top_left_y=945&top_left_x=357)

A straight line is drawn across the centre of the area, dividing it into a series of two different areas, A and B .

The area of each section, above and below the line, can be calculated separately using the formula for the area of a trapezium and then added together.

Along the line and at equal intervals of $h$, perpendicular lines are drawn up to the boundary. These ordinates (offsets) - $y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}$, etc - are the parallel sides of the trapezium.
Using the area formula for a trapezium, $\frac{a+b}{2} \times h$, we get $\mathrm{A}_{1}=\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2} \times h$. Similarly, $\mathrm{A}_{2}=\frac{y_{2}+y_{3}}{2} \times h$, and so on.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-185.jpg?height=359&width=494&top_left_y=1692&top_left_x=1139)

Therefore, the total area $\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{A}_{1}+\mathrm{A}_{2}+\mathrm{A}_{3}+\mathrm{A}_{4}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\left(\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2} \times h\right)+\left(\frac{y_{2}+y_{3}}{2} \times h\right)+\left(\frac{y_{3}+y_{4}}{2} \times h\right)+\left(\frac{y_{4}+y_{5}}{2} \times h\right) \\
& =\frac{h}{2}\left(y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{3}+y_{4}+y_{4}+y_{5}\right) \\
& =\frac{h}{2}\left[y_{1}+2\left(y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4}\right)+y_{5}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

In words, Area $\approx \frac{\text { interval width }}{2}[$ first height + last height $+2($ remaining heights $)]$
When $n$ strips are made, the Trapezoidal formula becomes

$$
\text { Area } \approx \frac{h}{2}\left[y_{1}+y_{n}+2\left(y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4}+\ldots . y_{n-1}\right)\right]
$$

Note 1: Because the top of each trapezium does not match the boundary at all points, the area obtained by this formula is only approximate.
Its accuracy depends on the gap width $h$; the smaller the gap width, the greater the accuracy.

Note 2: If offsets are measured from the same points above and below the line, then the area ( $\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B}$ ) can be obtained using

$$
\text { Area } \approx \frac{h}{2}\left[y_{1}+y_{7}+2\left(y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4}+y_{5}+y_{6}\right)\right]
$$

## Example 1

Using the measurements provided, find the area of this shape given $h=1$ unit.
$y_{1}=0, y_{2}=3, y_{3}=3.62, y_{4}=2.86$, $y_{5}=3, y_{6}=3.58, y_{7}=2.66$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-186.jpg?height=303&width=639&top_left_y=1760&top_left_x=899)

Area $\approx \frac{h}{2}\left[y_{1}+y_{7}+2\left(y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4}+y_{5}+y_{6}\right)\right]$
$=\frac{1}{2}[0+2.66+2(3+3.62+2.86+3+3.58)]=17.390$ sq. units

## Example 2

The circle shown has equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$.
(i) Find $y$ in terms of $x$.
(ii) Hence complete this table.

| $\boldsymbol{x}$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\boldsymbol{y}$ |  |  |  |  |  |  |

(iii) Use the table to estimate the area of the quarter-circle using intervals of $h=1$ unit.
(iv) Complete the table below using
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-187.jpg?height=522&width=550&top_left_y=276&top_left_x=984) intervals of $h=0.5$ unit.

| $\boldsymbol{x}$ | 0 | 0.5 | 1 | 1.5 | 2 | 2.5 | 3 | 3.5 | 4 | 4.5 | 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\boldsymbol{y}$ |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

(v) Compare both answers with the answer obtained from the area of a disc formula (correct to 3 places of decimals). What conclusion can be drawn?
(i) $x^{2}+y^{2}=25 \Rightarrow y^{2}=25-x^{2}$

$$
\Rightarrow y=\sqrt{25-x^{2}}
$$

(ii)

| $\boldsymbol{x}$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\boldsymbol{y}$ | 5 | $\sqrt{24}$ | $\sqrt{21}$ | 4 | 3 | 0 |

(iii) $\therefore$ Area $\approx \frac{1}{2}[5+0+2(\sqrt{24}+\sqrt{21}+4+3)]=18.982$ sq. units

| $\boldsymbol{x}$ | 0 | 0.5 | 1 | 1.5 | 2 | 2.5 | 3 | 3.5 | 4 | 4.5 | 5 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\boldsymbol{y}$ | 5 | 4.975 | 4.899 | 4.77 | 4.583 | 4.33 | 4 | 3.571 | 3 | 2.179 | 0 |

(iv) $\therefore$ Area $\approx \frac{0.5}{2}[5+0+2(4.975+4.899+4.77+4.584+4.33+4+3.571$ $+3+2.179)]=19.404$ sq. units
Area of $\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{disc}=\frac{1}{4} \pi r^{2}=\frac{1}{4} \pi 5^{2}=19.635$ sq. units
(v) As $h$ gets smaller, the answer approximates more closely to the disc formula answer. We also note that both the approximations are smaller than the true answer, as would be expected from the shape of the graph.

Note: If there are 5 strips, there are 6 ordinates.
If there are 10 strips, there are 11 ordinates.
If there are $n$ strips, there are $n+1$ ordinates.

## Probability 2

## Key words

```
tree diagram probability distribution expected value random variable
fair game binomial distribution Bernoulli trials multiplication rule
independent events normal distribution normal curve
Empirical rule standard score Probability simulations
```

In book 4, we dealt with permutations, combinations and the fundamentals of probability. In this chapter, we continue the study of probability and that will include more difficult concepts such as expected value and independent events as well as an introduction to the normal distribution.

## Section 7.1 Tree diagrams

The possible outcomes of two or more events can be shown in a particular type of diagram called a tree diagram. Each branch represents a possible outcome of one event. The probability of each outcome is written on the branch.
Consider this problem:
A fair coin is tossed three times.
Determine the probability that exactly 2 heads are obtained.
Here is the sample space of possible outcomes:
HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH and TTT
Since 2 heads appear on 3 occasions,

$$
P(2 \text { heads })=\frac{3}{8}
$$

The same possibilities can be represented in a more structured way on a tree diagram.

The branches that contain 2 heads are highlighted.

Again $P(2$ heads $)=\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}=\frac{3}{8}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-199.jpg?height=650&width=783&top_left_y=1608&top_left_x=851)

## Example 1

Box A contains 3 red beads and 4 blue beads Box B contains 2 red beads and 3 blue beads One bead is taken at random from each box.
(i) Draw a tree diagram to show all the outcomes.
(ii) Work out the probability that they both will
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-200.jpg?height=239&width=444&top_left_y=272&top_left_x=1099) have the same colour.
(i) The tree diagram below shows all the possible outcomes.

Taking a red bead from box A and taking a red bead from box B are independent events.
So $\mathrm{P}($ red, red $)=\mathrm{P}($ red $) \times \mathrm{P}($ red $)$

$$
\frac{3}{7} \times \frac{2}{5}=\frac{6}{35}
$$

| Box A | Outcome | Probability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-200.jpg?height=338&width=465&top_left_y=905&top_left_x=381) | R R <br> R B <br> B R <br> B B | $\frac{3}{7} \times \frac{2}{5}=\frac{6}{35}$ $\frac{3}{7} \times \frac{3}{5}=\frac{9}{35}$ <br> $\frac{4}{7} \times \frac{2}{5}=\frac{8}{35}$ <br> $\frac{4}{7} \times \frac{3}{5}=\frac{12}{35}$ |

(ii) $\mathrm{P}($ same colour $)=\mathrm{P}($ both red or both blue $)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{R}, \mathrm{R})+\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{~B}, \mathrm{~B}) \\
& =\frac{6}{35}+\frac{12}{35}=\frac{18}{35}
\end{aligned}
$$

OR implies addition

Note: Notice that the probabilities at the end of the branches sum to 1, i.e.,

$$
\frac{6}{35}+\frac{9}{35}+\frac{8}{35}+\frac{12}{35}=\frac{35}{35}=1
$$

## Tree diagrams for events without replacement

The tree diagram in the following example illustrates events that are not independent. The outcome of the first event affects subsequent events.

## Example 2

A box contains 12 beads. Five are yellow and the rest are green. A bead is removed from the box and its colour is noted. It is not returned to the box. A second selection is then made and the process is repeated, followed by a third selection.
(i) Draw a tree diagram outlining this situation
(ii) Find the probability of selecting exactly two green beads.
(i) First selection Second selection Third selection
$\mathrm{Y}=$ yellow bead
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-201.jpg?height=677&width=666&top_left_y=279&top_left_x=471)

$$
\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{YGG})=\frac{5}{12} \times \frac{7}{11} \times \frac{6}{10}=\frac{7}{44}
$$

or

$$
\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{GYG})=\frac{7}{12} \times \frac{5}{11} \times \frac{6}{10}=\frac{7}{44}
$$

or
$P(G G Y)=\frac{7}{12} \times \frac{6}{11} \times \frac{5}{10}=\frac{7}{44}$
(ii) So P (exactly two green beads) $=\frac{7}{44}+\frac{7}{44}+\frac{7}{44}$

$$
=\frac{21}{44}
$$

Note: In the example above, the calculations of probabilities were confined to the relevant branches.

## Section 7.2 Probability distributions - Expected value

## Probability distributions

Consider the following experiments
(i) 4 coins are tossed: $x$ is the number of heads obtained
(ii) Three dice are thrown: $x$ is the number of sixes obtained
(iii) A hand of 7 cards is dealt: $x$ is the number of kings
(iv) 100 people are selected: $x$ is the number of people of weight $\geqslant 150 \mathrm{~kg}$
(v) One person is selected at random: $x \mathrm{~cm}$ is the height of that person
(vi) One person is selected at random: $x$ is the I.Q. of that person.

In each of the above experiments, $x$ is called a random variable whose value depends, to some extent, on chance. In experiments (i) to (iv), $x$ can take discrete values such as $0,1,2$, $3 \ldots$ and for that reason $x$ is said to be a discrete random variable. In experiments (v) and (vi), $x$ can take any value within a certain range and is said to be a continuous random variable. In this section, we will consider only discrete random variables.

If a coin is tossed 3 times, the sample space of all possible outcomes is

## TTT, TTH, THT, THH, HTT, HTH, HHT, HHH

If $x$ is the number of heads obtained, a table of the results can be formulated as follows:

| $\boldsymbol{x}$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\boldsymbol{P}(\boldsymbol{x})$ | $\frac{1}{8}$ | $\frac{3}{8}$ | $\frac{3}{8}$ | $\frac{1}{8}$ |

This is called a probability distribution, where $P(x)$ is the probability that $x$ occurs.
Probability distributions are particularly useful when dealing with expected values, as shown below.

## Expected value

This circle is divided into 3 sectors.
When the spinner is spun, it will land on 4,8 or 12. If the spinner is spun twice and we get 4 and 12 , then the average of the two results is $\frac{4+12}{2}=8$.
If the spinner is spun 100 times, is there a quick way of finding the 'average' of these spins?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-204.jpg?height=295&width=293&top_left_y=1446&top_left_x=1268)

Yes and it is found by multiplying each outcome ( 4,8 or 12 ) by the probability of that outcome occurring and then adding the results.
This average is called the expected value.
This is set out in the table below:

| Outcome (x) | Probability (P) | $\boldsymbol{x} \times \boldsymbol{P}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 12 | $\frac{1}{2}$ | 6 |
| 8 | $\frac{1}{4}$ | 2 |
| 4 | $\frac{1}{4}$ | 1 |

When each outcome is multiplied by its corresponding probability, we get 6,2 and 1 . The sum of these results is 9 .
The number 9 is the expected value.
If the spinner above is spun a large number of times, the mean value of outcomes approaches the expected value, 9. Statisticians call this the Law of large numbers.

Notice that the expected value 9 is not one of the possible outcomes, i.e., 4, 8 and 12 .

The expected value of the outcome of an experiment is denoted by $\mathrm{E}(\mathrm{X})$.

In general, the expected value need not be one of the possible outcomes.

When all the outcomes are multiplied by their corresponding probabilities and the results added, the operation can be expressed in a concise way as follows

$$
\mathrm{E}(\mathrm{X})=\sum(x) \cdot P(x) \text {, where } \sum \text { represents 'the sum of'. }
$$

The expected value is widely used in the insurance industry and in the operation of casino games. If you would like to know whether or not a casino game is fair, you would need to know what the payout is and the probability of getting that payout. In simple terms, you need to know the expected value of the payouts.

You also have to take into account the money you pay to play the game.
Let us consider this fun-park spinning-wheel on the right. It costs $€ 8$ to spin the wheel and you win the amount to which the arrow is pointing.

Is this a fair game?
First we calculate the expected value of the payout.

| Payout (x) | Probability (P) | $\boldsymbol{x} \times \boldsymbol{P}$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $€ 10$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ | $€ 5$ |
| $€ 5$ | $\frac{1}{4}$ | $€ 1.25$ |
| $€ 4$ | $\frac{1}{4}$ | $€ 1$ |

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-205.jpg?height=327&width=441&top_left_y=1178&top_left_x=1194)

$$
\sum x . P(x)=€ 5+€ 1.25+€ 1=€ 7.25
$$

The expected value of the payout is $€ 7.25$.
But it costs $€ 8$ to spin the wheel.
The final (net) position is $€ 7.25-€ 8.00=-€ 0.75$.
Thus if the wheel is spun a large number of times, you could expect to lose $€ 0.75$ on average on each spin.

## When is a game fair?

To determine whether or not a game is mathematically fair, we need to take into account
(i) the expected value of the payout
(ii) the cost of playing the game.

Then (a) if the (expected value - cost) is zero, the game is fair
(b) if the (expected value - cost) is greater than zero, you will win in the long-run
(c) if the (expected value - cost) is less than zero, you will lose in the long-run.

A game is equitable or fair if the player's mathematical expectation is zero.

## Example 1

This circle is divided into 6 equal sectors.
You pay $€ 10$ to spin the arrow and you win the amount in the sector where the arrow stops.
What is the expected amount you win or lose in this game?
We find the expected value of the payout by constructing the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-206.jpg?height=288&width=288&top_left_y=568&top_left_x=1254) table below which shows the probability of each outcome.

| Payout $(\boldsymbol{x})$ | Probability $(\boldsymbol{P})$ | Payout $\times$ Probability $(\boldsymbol{x} \times \boldsymbol{P})$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $€ 0$ | $\frac{2}{6}$ | $€ 0$ |
| $€ 5$ | $\frac{1}{6}$ | $€ \frac{5}{6}$ |
| $€ 10$ | $\frac{2}{6}$ | $€ \frac{20}{6}$ |
| $€ 30$ | $\frac{1}{6}$ | $€ 5$ |

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Expected payout }=\sum x . P(x) & =€ 0+€ \frac{5}{6}+€ \frac{20}{6}+€ 5 \\
& =€ 5+€ \frac{25}{6} \\
& =€ 5+€ 4 \frac{1}{6}=€ 9 \frac{1}{6}=€ 9.17
\end{aligned}
$$

The expected payout is $€ 9.17$.
When you include the $€ 10$ you pay to play, the final (net) position is

$$
€ 9.17-€ 10=-€ 0.83
$$

So you can expect to lose $€ 0.83$ if you play this game.

## Example 2

Luke rolls a pair of dice in a game of chance that costs $€ 2$ to play. The table on the right gives the financial outcome for each event.
(i) Calculate the financial expectation for this game.
(ii) Is this game fair?

| Event | Financial outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| Any double | Win $€ 4$ |
| Total of 7 | Win €3 |
| Odd sum (except 7) | Money back (€2) |
| Even sum (except <br> doubles) | Lose € 3 |

Explain your answer.

There are 36 possible outcomes, as shown on the right.
(i) $P($ double $)=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}$
$P\left(\right.$ total of 7) $=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}$
$P($ odd sum - except 7$)=\frac{12}{36}=\frac{1}{3}$

| $6-$ | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $5-$ | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |
| $4-$ | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| $3-$ | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| $2-$ | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| $1-$ | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

We now multiply each financial outcome by its
$($ even sum - except doubles $)=\frac{18-6}{36}=\frac{12}{36}=\frac{1}{3}$ probability.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum x . P(x) & =€ 4 \times \frac{1}{6}+€ 3 \times \frac{1}{6}+€ 2 \times \frac{1}{3}-€ 3 \times \frac{1}{3} \\
& =€ \frac{4}{6}+€ \frac{1}{2}+€ \frac{2}{3}-€ 1 \\
& =€ \frac{11}{6}-€ 1=€ 1.83-€ 1=€ 0.83
\end{aligned}
$$

We now deduct the cost to play the game which is $€ 2$.

$$
€ 0.83-€ 2=-€ 1.17
$$

The financial expectation is $-€ 1.17$ per game.
(ii) This game is not fair as you expect to lose $€ 1.17$ each time you play this game.

## Section 7.3 Bernoulli trials - Binomial distribution

The Swiss mathematician James Bernoulli(1654-1705) studied the probabilities occurring when several trials of the one experiment were carried out.
The characteristics of a Bernoulli trial are:

1. Each trial can have only two outcomes often referred to as success and failure.
2. The trials are independent (the outcome of one has no influence over the outcome of another trial)
3. The probability of success / failure remains constant from trial to trial.
4. There is a fixed number of trials.

The probability of a success is generally called $p$.
The probability of a failure is $q$, where $p+q=1$.
The three main applications of his study are as follows:

## 1. To find the probability of a first success after $\boldsymbol{n}$ trials

## Example 1

Find the probability of getting a six on the fourth throw of an unbiased die.
The probability of getting a six on a single throw, $\mathrm{P}(6)=\frac{1}{6}=p$
The probability of not getting a six on a single throw, $\mathrm{P}(1,2,3,4,5)=\frac{5}{6}=q$
To get a six (success) on the fourth throw assumes no six (failure) on the first three throws.
$\therefore \mathrm{P}($ success on the fourth throw $)=q \times q \times q \times p=\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{1}{6}=\frac{5^{3}}{6^{4}}=\frac{125}{1296}$

## 2. To find the probability of $\boldsymbol{k}$ successes in $\boldsymbol{n}$ trials

A coin is biased in such a way that the probability of a head is always $\frac{2}{5}$.
Consider tossing the coin four times. We would like to know the probability of getting three heads.

This could happen in the four different ways $\{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{T}\}$ or $\{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{T}, \mathrm{H}\}$ or $\{\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{T}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H}\}$ or $\{\mathrm{T}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H}\}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P(\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{~T})=\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{3}{5}=\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{3} \times \frac{3}{5} \\
& P(\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{~T}, \mathrm{H})=\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{2}{5}=\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{3} \times \frac{3}{5} \\
& P(\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{~T}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H})=\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{5}=\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{3} \times \frac{3}{5} \\
& P(\mathrm{~T}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H})=\frac{3}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{5}=\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{3} \times \frac{3}{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

The total probability for 3 heads and 1 tail $=4 \times\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{3} \times \frac{3}{5}=\frac{96}{625}$
In book 4 we stated that $\binom{n}{r}$ represents the number of ways of choosing $r$ objects from $n$ different objects.
So the number of ways of selecting 3 heads from 4 (tosses of the) coins is $\binom{4}{3}$
Thus the probability of 3 heads and 1 tail $=\binom{4}{3}\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^{3} \times \frac{3}{5}$
The example above is a special type of probability model called the binomial distribution.
In general, the probability of $r$ successes in $n$ trials is given by the general term of the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^{n}$, where $p$ is the probability of success and $q$ is

$$
P(r \text { successes })=\binom{n}{r}(p)^{r}(q)^{n-r}
$$ the probability of failure.

Consider the event of obtaining a 6 from a single throw of an unbiased die.

$$
P(\text { success })=\frac{1}{6} \text { and } P(\text { failure })=\frac{5}{6}
$$

If there are 4 such trials, then the probability of $0,1,2,3,4$ successes from 4 attempts is given by the terms of the expansion of $\left(\frac{1}{6}+\frac{5}{6}\right)^{4}$
$P($ no six $)=\binom{4}{0}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{0}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{4}$
$P($ one six $)=\binom{4}{1}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{1}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{3}$
$P($ two sixes $)=\binom{4}{2}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{2}$
$P($ three sixes $)=\binom{4}{3}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{3}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{1}$
$P($ four sixes $)=\binom{4}{4}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{4}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{0}$

## Example 2

An unbiased die is thrown 5 times. Find the probability of obtaining
(i) 1 six
(ii) 3 sixes
(iii) at least 1 six.

Let $p=P$ (success, i.e. getting a six) and $q=P$ (failure).

$$
\Rightarrow \quad p=\frac{1}{6} \quad \text { and } \quad q=\frac{5}{6} \quad \text { and } \quad n=5
$$

(i) To find $P(1$ six $)$, we substitute 1 for $r$ and 4 for $(n-r)$ in the formula $\binom{n}{r} p^{r} q^{n-r}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow \quad P(1 \text { six })=\binom{5}{1} p^{1} q^{4} & =\binom{5}{1}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{4} \\
& =5 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{5^{4}}{6^{4}}=\frac{5^{5}}{6^{5}}=\frac{3125}{7776}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $P(3$ sixes $)=\binom{5}{3}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{3}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{2}$

$$
=10 \cdot \frac{1}{6^{3}} \cdot \frac{25}{36}=\frac{250}{7776}=\frac{125}{3888}
$$

(iii) $P($ at least 1 six $)=1-P($ no six $)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P(\text { no six })=\binom{5}{0}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{0}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{5}=\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{5} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad P(\text { at least } 1 \text { six })=1-\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{5}=\frac{4651}{7776}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

Given that $10 \%$ of apples are bad, find the probability that in a box containing 6 apples, there is
(i) no bad apple
(ii) just one bad apple
(iii) at least one bad apple.
$P(\operatorname{bad}$ apple $)=\frac{1}{10} \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(\operatorname{good}$ apple $)=\frac{9}{10}$

$$
\Rightarrow \quad p=\frac{1}{10} \quad \text { and } \quad q=\frac{9}{10} \quad \text { and } \quad n=6
$$

(i) $P$ (no bad apple) is the term where the power of $p$ is zero.

$$
=\binom{6}{0}\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)^{0}\left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^{6}=\left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^{6}=\frac{9^{6}}{10^{6}}
$$

(ii) $P(1$ bad apple $)=\binom{6}{1}\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)^{1}\left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^{5}$ the power of $p=1$

$$
=6 \cdot \frac{1}{10} \cdot\left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^{5}=\frac{6.9^{5}}{10^{6}}
$$

(iii) $\quad P($ at least 1 bad apple $)=1-P($ no bad apple $)$

$$
=1-\frac{9^{6}}{10^{6}} \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \text { from (i) above }
$$

## 3. To find the probability of $\boldsymbol{k}^{\text {th }}$ success on the $\boldsymbol{n}^{\text {th }}$ Bernoulli trial

In example 2 on the previous page, we worked out the probability of getting 3 sixes when a dice is thrown 5 times. If the same dice is thrown continuously until a six appears for the fourth time, how do we find the probability that the 4th six appears on the tenth throw?

For a 4th six to appear on the 10th throw,
(i) we need to get 3 sixes on the first nine throws, and then
(ii) get a six on the 10 th throw.

Three sixes on the first nine throws is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\binom{9}{3} p^{3} q^{9-3} \quad \text { i.e. }\binom{9}{3}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{3}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{6} \\
& 84 \times \frac{5^{6}}{6^{9}}=0.13
\end{aligned}
$$

$P($ six on the 10 th throw $)=\frac{1}{6}$
Thus $P(4$ th six on the 10 th throw $)=0.13 \times \frac{1}{6}=0.0217$.

## Example 4

A card is drawn at random from a normal deck of playing cards and then replaced. The process is repeated until the third diamond appears.
Find the probability that this happens when the tenth card is drawn.
$\mathrm{P}($ drawing a diamond $)=\frac{1}{4}$
The probability of drawing the third diamond on the 10th draw is

$$
\begin{gathered}
P(\text { drawing } 2 \text { diamonds in the first nine draws }) \times \\
P(\text { drawing a diamond on the } 10 \text { th draw })
\end{gathered}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(2 \text { diamonds on 1st nine draws }) & =\binom{9}{2}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{7} \\
& =0.3 \\
P(\text { diamond on } 10 \text { th draw }) & =\frac{1}{4}=0.25
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $P($ third diamond on the 10 th draw $)=0.3 \times 0.25$

$$
=0.075
$$

## Section 7.4 How to show events are independent

In book 4, it was stated that two events are independent when the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the other event.

We also used conditional probability to get a multiplication rule for independent events as follows:
$P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})=\frac{P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})}{P(\mathrm{~B})} \quad \ldots($ conditional probability $)$
$\therefore P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})=P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B}) \times P(\mathrm{~B}) \quad \ldots($ general multiplication rule $)$
In the case of independent events A and B , where the occurrence of one event has no effect on the other we conclude that;
$P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})=P(\mathrm{~A})$
$\therefore \quad P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})=P(\mathrm{~A}) \times P(\mathrm{~B})$
Multiplication rule for independent events:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P(A \cap B)=P(A) \cdot P(B) \\
& P(A \text { and } B)=P(A) \cdot P(B)
\end{aligned}
$$

In this section, we will use the multiplication rule to determine whether or not two events are independent. The following examples will illustrate the procedure.

## Example 1

In a group of 60 students, 20 study History, 24 study French, 8 study both History and French and 24 study neither.
Illustrate this information on a Venn diagram.
Now investigate if the events 'a student studies History' and 'a student studies French' are independent.
$P($ History $)=\frac{20}{60}=\frac{1}{3}$
$P($ French $)=\frac{24}{60}=\frac{2}{5}$
$P($ History and French $)=\frac{8}{60}=\frac{2}{15}$
Now $P($ History $) \times P($ French $)=\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{5}=\frac{2}{15}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-216.jpg?height=329&width=430&top_left_y=1684&top_left_x=1112)

Thus $P($ History and French $)=P($ History $) \times P($ French $)=\frac{2}{15}$
The two events are independent.

## Example 2

Two events A and B are such that $P(\mathrm{~A})=0.5, P(\mathrm{~B})=0.4$ and $P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})=0.3$.
(i) Find $P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})$.
(ii) Investigate whether or not the events A and B are independent.
(i) Using the conditional probability rule, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& & P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B}) & =\frac{P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})}{P(\mathrm{~B})} \\
& \therefore & 0.3 & =\frac{P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})}{0.4} \\
\therefore & & P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B}) & =(0.3)(0.4)=0.12 \\
\therefore & & P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B}) & =0.12
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) $P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})=0.12 \quad P(\mathrm{~A})=0.5 \quad P(\mathrm{~B})=0.4$

$$
P(\mathrm{~A}) \times P(\mathrm{~B})=0.5 \times 0.4=0.2
$$

Since $P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})=0.12 \Rightarrow P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B}) \neq P(\mathrm{~A}) \times P(\mathrm{~B})$
Thus the events A and B are not independent.

## Example 3

Two ordinary fair dice, one red and one blue, are to be rolled once.
(i) Find the probability of the following events:

Event $A$ : the number showing on the red dice will be a 5 or a 6 .
Event $B$ : the total of the numbers showing on the two dice will be 7 .
Event $C$ : the total of the numbers showing on the two dice will be 8 .
(ii) Show that events A and B are independent.
(iii) Investigate if events A and C are independent.
(i) The events $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and C are shown on the right.
$\# \mathrm{~A}=12 \quad \therefore \quad P(\mathrm{~A})=\frac{12}{36}=\frac{1}{3}$
$\# \mathrm{~B}=6 \quad \therefore P(\mathrm{~B})=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}$
$\# \mathrm{C}=5 \quad \therefore P(\mathrm{C})=\frac{5}{36}$
(ii) There are two ways to score 7 with the red dice showing 5 or 6 .
These are $(5,2)$ and $(6,1)$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-217.jpg?height=444&width=451&top_left_y=1454&top_left_x=1095)

So $\#(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})=2 \Rightarrow P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})=\frac{2}{36}=\frac{1}{18}$
Now $P(\mathrm{~A}) \times P(\mathrm{~B})=\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{18}$
Since $P(A \cap B)=P(A) \times P(B)=\frac{1}{18}$, events $A$ and $B$ are independent.
(iii) From the diagram $\#(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{C})=2$.

These are $(5,3)$ and $(6,2)$.
Thus $\#(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{C})=2 \Rightarrow P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{C})=\frac{2}{36}=\frac{1}{18}$
Now $P(\mathrm{~A}) \times P(\mathrm{C})=\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{36}=\frac{5}{108}$
Since $\frac{5}{108} \neq \frac{1}{18}$, then $P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{C}) \neq P(\mathrm{~A}) \times P(\mathrm{C})$.
Thus events A and C are not independent.

Remember: 1. If two events are independent,

$$
P(\mathrm{~A} \text { and } \mathrm{B})=P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})=P(\mathrm{~A}) \cdot P(\mathrm{~B}) \quad \ldots(P(\mathrm{~A} \mid \mathrm{B})=P(\mathrm{~A})) .
$$

2. If two events are mutually exclusive, $P(\mathrm{~A}$ or B$)=P(\mathrm{~A} \cup \mathrm{~B})=P(\mathrm{~A})+P(\mathrm{~B}) \quad \ldots(P(\mathrm{~A} \cap \mathrm{~B})=0)$.

## Section 7.5 Probability involving permutations and combinations

Many of the more difficult problems in probability involve the use of permutations or combinations to identify the number of possible outcomes or the number of favourable outcomes. While many problems can be solved in more than one way, the following worked examples will illustrate how combinations, in particular, can be used to solve certain types of problem.
Remember $\binom{n}{r}=$ the number of ways of selecting $r$ objects from $n$.
e.g. the number of ways of selecting 3 students from 6 is $\binom{6}{3}=20$

## Example 1

In Class 6A, two boys and four girls study music.
In Class 6B, four boys and six girls study music.
Two pupils are chosen at random from each of the two classes to perform at a concert.
(i) In how many ways can the 4 pupils be selected?
(ii) Calculate the probability that the four chosen consist of 2 boys from 6 A and 2 girls from 6B.
(iii) Calculate the probability that the four pupils are of the same gender.

For convenience, we will set out the information in the form of a table.

| $\mathbf{6 A}$ | 2 Boys | 4 Girls |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\mathbf{6 B}$ | 4 Boys | 6 Girls |

(i) The number of ways 2 pupils can be selected from 6 A and 2 pupils from 6 B is,

$$
\binom{6}{2} \times\binom{ 10}{2}=675 \text { ways. }
$$

(ii) Two boys from 6 A and two girls from 6 B can be chosen in

$$
\begin{gathered}
\binom{2}{2} \times\binom{ 6}{2}=1 \times 15=15 \text { ways } \\
P(2 \text { boys from } 6 \mathrm{~A} \text { and } 2 \text { girls from } 6 \mathrm{~B})=\frac{15}{675}=\frac{1}{45}
\end{gathered}
$$

(iii) If the four pupils are of the same gender, they will consist of
(a) 2 girls from 6 A and 2 girls from 6 B
or (b) 2 boys from 6 A and 2 boys from 6 B .

$$
\begin{array}{ll} 
& P(a)=\frac{\binom{4}{2} \times\binom{ 6}{2}}{675}=\frac{6 \times 15}{675}=\frac{90}{675} \\
& P(b)=\frac{\binom{2}{2} \times\binom{ 4}{2}}{675}=\frac{1 \times 6}{675}=\frac{6}{675} \\
\therefore & P(a \text { or } b)=P(a)+P(b)=\frac{90}{675}+\frac{6}{675}=\frac{96}{675}=\frac{32}{225}
\end{array}
$$

## Example 2

Three cards are drawn at random, and without replacement, from a pack of 52 playing cards. Find the probability that
(i) the three cards drawn are the Jack of spades, the Queen of clubs and the King of clubs
(ii) the three cards are aces
(iii) two cards are red and the third one is a club
(iv) the three cards are of the same colour.
(i) Three cards can be selected from 52 cards in $\binom{52}{3}$ ways.

$$
\binom{52}{3}=\frac{52 \times 51 \times 50}{3 \times 2 \times 1}=22100
$$

The three cards mentioned can be selected in $\binom{3}{3}$ i.e. 1 way

$$
\therefore \quad P(\mathrm{~J} . . \mathrm{Q} . . \mathrm{K})=\frac{1}{22100}
$$

(ii) Three aces can be selected from four aces in $\binom{4}{3}$ ways

$$
\therefore \quad P(3 \text { aces })=\frac{\binom{4}{3}}{\binom{52}{3}}=\frac{4}{22100}=\frac{1}{5525}
$$

(iii) Two red cards and one club can be selected in

$$
\begin{array}{ll} 
& \binom{26}{2} \times\binom{ 13}{1}=\frac{26 \times 25}{2 \times 1} \times 13=4225 \text { ways } \\
\therefore & P(2 \text { red and } 1 \text { club })=\frac{4225}{22100}=\frac{169}{884}=\frac{13}{68}
\end{array}
$$

(iv) $\quad P(3$ cards of the same colour $)=P(3$ black or 3 red $)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =P(3 \text { black })+P(3 \text { red }) \\
& =\frac{\binom{26}{3}}{\binom{52}{3}}+\frac{\binom{26}{3}}{\binom{52}{3}}=\frac{5200}{22100}=\frac{4}{17}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Events occurring at least once

Many questions in probability contain phrases such as "at least once", "at least one red disc", etc. Take, for example, the probability of getting at least one 4 when a pair of dice are thrown.

First get the probability that no 4 is thrown.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P(\text { no } 4)=P(\text { no } 4 \text { on } 1 \text { st throw }) \times P(\text { no } 4 \text { on } 2 \text { nd throw })=\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6}=\frac{25}{36} \\
& P(\text { at least one } 4)=1-P(\text { no } 4)=1-\frac{25}{36}=\frac{11}{36}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, if a coin is tossed four times, the probability of getting at least two heads is

$$
P(\text { at least } 2 \text { heads })=1-P(\text { no head })-P(1 \text { head })
$$

In general, if $E$ is any event, then

$$

## Section 7.6 Probability simulations

The word simulate means to imitate or model. The use of simulation is becoming an increasingly-powerful tool in the modern world of business. In the past, when an engineer was designing a new car or aeroplane, he would build a physical model first and test its performance in wind tunnels. Now, initial tests are done on computers through the use of simulation programmes.

A probability simulation is the use of some method to model or represent a real experiment or situation.

Simulations can involve
> dice, spinners, discs and counters
> calculators and computers to generate random numbers
> random number tables
You may also use experiments in simulation.

## Example 1

With every breakfast cereal pack there is a free coloured toy. There are 6 different colours of toys.
How many packs of breakfast cereal do you need to buy to collect the 6 differentcoloured toys?

A simulation can give you some indication of how many packets you need to buy.
(i) Match each colour to a number on a dice.
(ii) Roll the dice until each colour has appeared once.

$$
2,2,6,4,2,2,5,1,4,5,4,3
$$

All six numbers have occurred in the first 12 rolls.
Based on this simulation, you would need to buy 12 packets.
(iii) Repeat the simulation.

$$
3,1,3,1,4,6,6,5,3,5,6,3,5,2
$$

This time you would need to buy 14 packets.
(iv) Repeat this as many times as you like.

The more times you repeat the experiment, the more confidence you have in the results.

## Think!

Can you propose an alternative way to find how many packets you need to buy?
Perhaps your method might include the following:
> generate a random number table
> use a spreadsheet
> use a spinner
> get your friends to buy some boxes to see how many you need to buy to get a full set.
The advantages of simulation are:
> It is quick and inexpensive
> When using a spreadsheet, you can get several hundred pieces of data
> You can adjust the probability to cater for events that are not equally likely.

## Example 2

In families that have 5 children, we wish to investigate the probability that boys outnumber girls.
Devise a simulation of this situation and use it to determine whether the probability is more than, less than, or equal to $\frac{1}{2}$.

Assume that each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl.
Suppose you choose to toss 5 coins at a time to simulate the genders of the 5 children in the family, where head stands for boy and tail stands for girl.
In 4 tosses we get the following results:

TTTTT
THHHH
THTHH
HHTTT

5 girls
1 girl, 4 boys
2 girls, 3 boys
3 girls, 2 boys

Girls outnumber boys
Boys outnumber girls
Boys outnumber girls
Girls outnumber boys

After 100 tosses, we get the following results:

| Outcome | Frequency |
| :---: | :---: |
| Boys outnumbering | 53 |
| Girls outnumbering | 47 |

It appears that the outcomes are fairly even and that the probability that boys outnumber girls is about $\frac{1}{2}$.

Using a spreadsheet, this experiment was simulated and the result is shown in the table below:

| Outcome | Frequency |
| :---: | :---: |
| Boys outnumbering | 48 |
| Girls outnumbering | 52 |

This outcome shows a similar result.

This example could also be modelled by
(i) Rolling a dice with $1-3$ indicates boy and $4-6$ indicates girl
(ii) Random numbers using a calculator or a table of random numbers:
$0-4$ indicates boy and 5-9 indicates girl
(iii) selecting from a deck of playing cards:
red indicates girl and black indicates boy

## Example 3

Four people are selected at random from a large crowd.
What is the probability that two or more of them have birthdays in the same month?
(i) Devise a simulation that could determine the probability of this happening.
(ii) Run the simulation 100 times and approximate the probability.
(i) Possible simulations:
> Write down the 12 months of the year on separate cards and draw them out of a box.
> Remove all the kings from a deck of cards, then select a card from the remaining 48:
Ace $=$ January, $2=$ February, ... etc.
> Use a calculator or spreadsheet to generate random numbers from 1 to 12.
> Toss a dice and coin together (there are 12 possible outcomes). H1 $=$ January, H2 $=$ February, $\ldots$ etc.
(ii) Simulation result

## Shared birthday

| 6 | 8 | 1 | 2 | No |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| 1 | 8 | 1 | 11 | Yes |
| 5 | 11 | 6 | 10 | No |
| 8 | 8 | 10 | 12 | Yes |
| 10 | 8 | 2 | 4 | No |
| 5 | 6 | 12 | 10 | No |

> The above 6 results were found using the random number function on a calculator.
> When this experiment was conducted 100 times, the following results were recorded.

| Shared birthday | Frequency |
| :---: | :---: |
| Yes | 45 |
| No | 55 |

From these results, we can conclude that the probability of two, three or more people, from a random group of four sharing the same birthday, is about $45 \%$.

Note: This answer seems surprisingly high but the true (calculated) probability is $42.7 \%$.

## 8 Functions and Graphs

## Key words

function domain mapping diagram codomain range domain intervals inverse functions composite functions injective, surjective and bijective functions limit continuous functions asymptote exponential function logarithmic function related graphs

## Section 8.1 Introduction to functions

In our study of maths so far, we have dealt with points such as $(2,4)$ and $(-3,2)$ and learned how to plot these points on the coordinated plane.
Points such as $(2,4)$ and $(-3,2)$ are examples of ordered pairs.
An ordered pair, denoted by $(x, y)$, is a pair of elements $x$ and $y$ in which $x$ is considered to be the first element and $y$ is the second element.

A set of ordered pairs such as $A=\{(1,2),(2,4),(3,6),(4,8)\}$ is called a relation. Every relation determines two sets.
The set of all the first elements of the ordered pairs is called the domain.
The set of all the second elements of the ordered pairs is called the range.
Some relations may be defined by a rule relating elements in the domain to their corresponding elements in the range.

In order to define the relation fully, we need to specify both the rule and the domain.
For example, $\{(x, y) \mid y=2 x+1, x \in\{1,2,3,4\}\}$ is the relation

$$
\{(1,3),(2,5),(3,7),(4,9)\} .
$$

The domain is the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$ and the range is the set $\{3,5,7,9\}$.
The relation above may be represented by a mapping diagram, as shown.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-234.jpg?height=352&width=390&top_left_y=1870&top_left_x=1189)

## Functions

Functions are special relations with individual properties.
They are often referred to as "number machines", with inputs and outputs.
When is a relation a function?
A function is a relation for which each $\boldsymbol{x}$-value in an input set, there is a unique $\boldsymbol{y}$-value of an output set.

When a function is represented by a mapping diagram, each element of the domain maps onto one and only one element of the range.

Consider these two mapping diagrams:
(i)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-235.jpg?height=310&width=395&top_left_y=654&top_left_x=295)
(ii)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-235.jpg?height=312&width=400&top_left_y=655&top_left_x=927)

Diagram (i) is not a function since the element $b$ is paired with 2 different elements in the range.
Diagram (ii) is a function since each element in the domain is mapped onto one and only one element in the range.

## Remember

1. In the mapping of a function, only one arrow comes from each element of the domain.
2. Each element of the domain is operated on by the function.

## Notation - domain - range

Consider this rule for a function: "Square the input and add six."
If we input $x$, the output will be $x^{2}+6$.
The rule for this function may be written in any of the three ways shown on the right.
(i) $f(x)=x^{2}+6$
(ii) $f: x \rightarrow x^{2}+6$
(iii) $y=x^{2}+6$

When dealing with the domain and range of a function, it is important to know what the basic number systems are. These are given below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \boldsymbol{N}=\{1,2,3, \ldots\}, \text { the set of natural numbers, } \\
& \boldsymbol{Z}=\{\ldots-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, \ldots\}, \text { the set of integers, } \\
& \boldsymbol{Q}=\left\{\text { fractions, } \frac{a}{b}, a, b \in Z, b \neq 0\right\}, \text { the set of rational numbers, } \\
& \boldsymbol{R} \backslash \boldsymbol{Q}=\text { the set of irrational numbers, e.g. } \pi, \sqrt{2}, e, \text { etc. }
\end{aligned}
$$

When all these numbers are combined, we get the set of real numbers, $\boldsymbol{R}$.
$\boldsymbol{R}^{+}$is the set of positive real numbers.
Consider the function $f: N \rightarrow N: x \rightarrow x^{2}$.
This means that the set of input numbers comes from $N$, the set of natural numbers.
The output numbers also come from the set $N$.
The set of possible output numbers is called the codomain.
However, the outputs generated by the function $f: N \rightarrow N: x \rightarrow x^{2}$ are the square numbers $1,4,9,16, \ldots$
The set of actual outcomes of a function is called the range.
The range is always a subset of the codomain.
However, in some functions, the range and codomain may be the same set.
The function $f: N \rightarrow N: x \rightarrow x^{2}$ is shown on the right.
Domain $=N$
Codomain $=N$
Range $=\{1,4,9,16, \ldots\}$

Now consider the function $f: R \rightarrow R: x \rightarrow x^{2}+2$.
The domain of $f$ is the set of real numbers $R$.
The codomain is also $R$.
Domain intervals: When we have an input, a function gives certainty about the output. To create functions from certain relations, it is necessary to restrict the domain and create intervals in which the relation is a function.

1. When dealing with the $\log$ function $f: R^{+} \rightarrow R: x \rightarrow \ln x$, the domain must be restricted to values of $x>0$, that is, $x \in R^{+}$.
We cannot get the log of a negative number.
2. For the function $f(x)=\sqrt{4-x^{2}}$, the domain must exclude the values $x<-2$ or $x>2$ as these values for $x$ result in the square root of a negative number which is not a real number.
Thus, the domain is $-2 \leq x \leq 2$.
The main features of a function are highlighted below:

## Vertical line test for a function

A very useful way to identify whether or not a relation is a function is to draw a graph of the relation and apply the vertical line test.
If a vertical line can be drawn anywhere on the graph, and it intersects the graph more than once, then the relation is not a function.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-237.jpg?height=341&width=395&top_left_y=447&top_left_x=406)
$f(x)=x(x-3)^{2}$ is a function.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-237.jpg?height=371&width=371&top_left_y=446&top_left_x=1059)
$x^{2}+y^{2}=4$ is not a function.

## Example 1

$f(x)=4 x+3$ and $g(x)=3 x^{2}$ are two functions.
Find $\begin{array}{llll}\text { (i) } f(3) & \text { (ii) } g(-1) & \text { (iii) } f(2 k) & \text { (iv) } g(k-3) \text {. }\end{array}$
(i) $f(x)=4 x+3$
$\Rightarrow f(3)=4(3)+3$
$=15$
(iii) $\quad f(x)=4 x+3$
$f(2 k)=4(2 k)+3$
$=8 k+3$
(ii) $\quad g(x)=3 x^{2}$
$\Rightarrow g(-1)=3(-1)^{2}$
$=3$
(iv) $\quad g(x)=3 x^{2}$
$g(k-3)=3(k-3)^{2}$
$=3\left(k^{2}-6 k+9\right)$
$=3 k^{2}-18 k+27$

## Example 2

(iii) $h(x)$ is a function as any vertical line intersects the graph once only.

When describing intervals, the parentheses shown on the right are generally used.

3. $\{x \in R \mid a \leqslant x<b\}=[a, b)$

$R^{+}$is the set of positive

## Section 8.2 Composition of functions

The diagram below shows a function $f$ illustrated by the mapping diagram from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$, and the function $g$ illustrated by the mapping diagram from B to C .

The red arrows represent the couples of a new function combining $f$ and $g$.

It is called the composite function $g$ after $f$.
It is written as $\boldsymbol{g} \circ \boldsymbol{f}$, or simply $\boldsymbol{g} \boldsymbol{f}$.
$g \circ f$ is read ' $g$ after $f$ '.
The couples $g \circ f$ from the diagram are $\{(1,11),(3,15),(5,19)\}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-243.jpg?height=399&width=628&top_left_y=357&top_left_x=1001)

We will now consider two functions, $f(x)=2 x+5$ and $g(x)=x-3$, to find the rule for the composite function $g f(x)$.

These functions are illustrated on the right. In $f$, the output is $(2 x+5)$ when the input is $x$.

We will now use $(2 x+5)$ as the input for the function $g$.

Since $g(x)=x-3$, then $g f(x)=g(2 x+5)$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-243.jpg?height=315&width=637&top_left_y=894&top_left_x=992)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =(2 x+5)-3 \\
g f(x) & =2 x+2
\end{aligned}
$$

$\ldots$ replacing $x$ with $(2 x+5)$

We will now consider what happens when the order of the functions is changed.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f g(x) & =f(x-3) \\
& =2(x-3)+5 \quad \ldots \text { replacing } x \text { with }(x-3) \\
f g(x) & =2 x-1
\end{aligned}
$$

In general, if $f$ and $g$ are two functions,

$$
\text { then } f g(x) \neq g f(x)
$$

Since $2 x+2 \neq 2 x-1$, this shows that $g f(x) \neq f g(x)$. i.e. the composition of functions (generally) is not commutative

## Example 1

Given that $f(x)=x+3$ and $g(x)=x^{2}-1$, find
(i) $f g(2)$
(ii) $g f(-1)$
(iii) $f g(x)$
(iv) $g f(x)$.

Find also the value of $x$ for which $f g(x)=g f(x)$.
(i) $f g(2)=f(3)=6 \quad \ldots g(2)=2^{2}-1=3$
(ii) $g f(-1)=g(2)=3$
(iii) $f g(x)=f\left(x^{2}-1\right)=\left(x^{2}-1\right)+3=x^{2}+2$
(iv) $g f(x)=g(x+3)=(x+3)^{2}-1=x^{2}+6 x+9-1$

$$
=x^{2}+6 x+8
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
f g(x)=g f(x) \Rightarrow x^{2}+2 & =x^{2}+6 x+8 \\
0 & =6 x+6 \\
\text { i.e. } 6 x+6 & =0 \\
6 x & =-6 \Rightarrow x=-1
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: $f \circ f(x)$ is written as $f^{2}(x)$.

## Example 2

Given $f(x)=2 x+1, g(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ and $h(x)=x^{2}-4$, find
(i) $g f(x)$
(ii) $f^{2}(x)$
(iii) $g h(x)$
(iv) $h^{2}(x)$
(v) $h f g(x)$
(vi) the values of $x$ for which $g h(x)=\frac{1}{12}$.
(i) $g f(x)=g(2 x+1)$

$$
=\frac{1}{2 x+1}
$$

(ii) $f^{2}(x)=f(2 x+1)$

$$
=2(2 x+1)+1
$$

$$
=4 x+3
$$

(iii) $g h(x)=g\left(x^{2}-4\right)$

$$
=\frac{1}{x^{2}-4}
$$

(iv) $h^{2}(x)=h\left(x^{2}-4\right)$

$$
=\left(x^{2}-4\right)^{2}-4
$$

$$
=x^{4}-8 x^{2}+12

## Section 8.3 Types of functions

In Section 8.1 of this chapter, a function was described as a relation where there is a unique output value for each input value.
In this section, we will discuss types of functions such as injective, surjective and bijective functions.

## 1. Injective functions

A function $f$, from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$, is said to be injective or one-to-one if every output in B has a unique input in A .
In a mapping diagram, no two inputs in A will have the same output in B; hence, the phrase 'one-to-one'.

Note: It is not necessary that every element in the codomain has a corresponding element in the domain.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-246.jpg?height=348&width=390&top_left_y=1752&top_left_x=1238)

In the diagram on the right, 8 has no corresponding input; however, the mapping diagram still represents an injective function.

## Examples

$1 f: R \rightarrow R: y=x+5$.
This function generates the couples such as $(0,5),(1,6),(-2,3),(-7,-2), \ldots$
Each element in the domain has a unique corresponding element in the codomain.
Hence, $f$ is an injective function.
2 The function $f(x)=x^{2}$ is not a one-to-one function as, for example, $f(-3)=9$ and $f(3)=9$; hence, 9 does not have a unique input.

## Horizontal line test for injective functions

The diagram on the right shows the graph of $y=x^{3}$.
If $y=x^{3}$ is an injective function, then any line drawn parallel to the $x$-axis will intersect the curve at most once. The diagram shows that $y=x^{3}$ is an injective function.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-247.jpg?height=395&width=456&top_left_y=576&top_left_x=1177)

## 2. Surjective (many-to-one) functions

A function $f$ is surjective if every element of the codomain is the image of at least one element of the domain.

A surjective function may also be described as a mapping of A onto B .
No element of the codomain is left unused.
Hence, the range and the codomain are equal.

For any function $f$, if the range and the codomain are equal, then the function is surjective.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-247.jpg?height=352&width=397&top_left_y=1201&top_left_x=1237)

## Horizontal line test for surjective functions

Consider the function $f: R \rightarrow R$.
If $f$ is surjective, then every horizontal line drawn must intersect the graph at least once. The function $y=x^{3}$, where $x \in R$, is surjective as every horizontal line intersects the graph at least once.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-247.jpg?height=397&width=458&top_left_y=1680&top_left_x=1176)

## 3. Bijective functions

A function $f$ is bijective if for every element $y$ in $\mathbf{B}$, there is exactly one element $x$ in A such that $f(x)=y$.

Therefore, a bijective function is both injective and surjective.

From the diagram, it can be seen that there is an exact one-to-one match between the elements in A and B . This function is bijective.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-248.jpg?height=348&width=390&top_left_y=241&top_left_x=1238)

## Example 1

State whether the following maps $\mathrm{A} \rightarrow \mathrm{B}$ are
(i) functions
(ii) injective
(iii) surjective
(iv) bijective.

Give reasons for your answers.
(a)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-248.jpg?height=343&width=388&top_left_y=861&top_left_x=355)
(b)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-248.jpg?height=343&width=388&top_left_y=861&top_left_x=1001)
(c)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-248.jpg?height=343&width=387&top_left_y=1229&top_left_x=681)
(a) $f$ is a function; only one arrow from each element in A .
$f$ is injective; each element in A maps to only one element in B .
$f$ is not surjective; an element in $\mathbf{B}$ is not in the range of $f$.
$f$ is not bijective as it is not both injective and surjective.
(b) $g$ is a function; only one arrow from each element in A .
$g$ is injective; each element in A maps to only one element in B.
$g$ is surjective; each element in B is the image of some element in A .
$g$ is therefore bijective.
(c) $h$ is a function; only one arrow from each element in A.
$h$ is not injective; more than one element in A maps to the same element in B.
$h$ is not surjective; all the elements in B are not included in the mapping.
$h$ is not bijective.

## Example 2

The graph of the function
$f: R \rightarrow R: x \rightarrow x^{2}-2$ is shown.
(i) What is the range of $f$ ?
(ii) Explain why $f$ is not injective.
(iii) Explain why $f$ is not surjective.
(iv) Suggest a domain for $f$ to make the function injective.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-249.jpg?height=352&width=418&top_left_y=272&top_left_x=1125)
(v) Suggest a codomain for $f$ to make the function surjective.
(i) The lowest $y$-value of the graphed function is $y=-2$.
$\therefore$ The range of $f$ is $y \geqslant-2$ or $[-2, \infty)$.
(ii) $f$ is not injective as any horizontal line in the given range will intersect the curve at more than one point.
[OR: -2 is mapped onto 2, and also 2 is mapped onto 2. Hence, there is not a unique output for each input.]
(iii) $f$ is not surjective as the range of $f$ is $y \geqslant-2$ and the codomain of $f$ is $R$.

Since the codomain and range are not equal, $f$ is not surjective.
(iv) If the domain is restricted to $x \geqslant 0$, we get the graph shown on the right.
Since a horizontal line will intersect this graph at one point only, this function is injective.
(v) If the codomain of $f$ is restricted to $y \geqslant-2$, then the codomain and range are the same. Hence, the function would be surjective.

## Section 8.4 Inverse functions

In previous sections, we have seen that a function generates a set of $y$-values, called the range, from a set of $x$-values, called the domain.

In this section, we will deal with the reverse of this procedure by finding the elements of the domain when given the elements of the range.

In the given mapping diagram, the couples of $f$ are:

$$
f=(1,4),(3,7),(5,10),(7,13)
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-252.jpg?height=416&width=402&top_left_y=1815&top_left_x=1235)

If we reverse these couples, we get a new function called $\boldsymbol{f}^{\boldsymbol{- 1}}$. $f^{-1}$ is said to be the inverse function of $f$.
From the mapping diagram, $f^{-1}=(4,1),(7,3),(10,5),(13,7)$.
For every couple $(a, b)$ that $f$ creates, $f^{-1}$ will create the couple $(b, a)$.
Thus, $f$ and $f^{-1}$ create points that are reflections of one another in the line $y=x$.

Note: As can be seen from the diagram, a function $f$ has an inverse if and only if it is bijective, i.e. the function must be one to one and onto. Take the function $f(x)=x^{2}$.
$(2,4)$ and $(-2,4)$ are couples of $f$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-253.jpg?height=456&width=503&top_left_y=338&top_left_x=1125)

So the couples $(4,2)$ and $(4,-2)$ are couples of $f^{-1}$.
This shows that $f^{-1}$ is not a function as the input 4 does not have a unique output.
Since $f(x)=x^{2}$ is not bijective, it does not have an inverse.

## How to find the inverse of a function

$$
\text { Let } \begin{aligned}
f(x) & =3 x-2 \\
\Rightarrow \quad y & =3 x-2 \\
3 x & =y+2 \\
x & =\frac{y+2}{3} \quad \ldots \text { express } x \text { in terms of } y \\
\therefore \quad f^{-1}(x) & =\frac{x+2}{3} \quad \ldots \text { replace } y \text { with } x \\
f^{-1}(x) & =\frac{x+2}{3} \text { is the inverse function of } f(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

We can verify that the inverse function is correct by showing that $f(3)=7$ and $f^{-1}(7)=3$.

## Example 1

(i) If $f(x)=5 x-3$, find $f^{-1}(x)$.
(ii) Hence, show that $f^{-1} f(x)=x$.
(i) Let $y=5 x-3$
(ii) $f^{-1} f(x)=f^{-1}(5 x-3)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
5 x & =y+3 \\
x & =\frac{y+3}{5} \\
(x) & =\frac{x+3}{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =5\left(\frac{x+3}{5}\right)-3 \\
& =x+3-3 \\
& =x
\end{aligned}
$$

In Example 1 above, it was shown that $f^{-1} f(x)=x$.
It can also be shown that $f f^{-1}(x)=x$.

For any two functions $f$ and $f^{-1}$, then
(i) $f f^{-1}(x)=x$.
(ii) $f^{-1} f(x)=x$.

## Example 2

The diagram on the right shows the reflection of the curve $f(x)=x^{3}+1$ in the line $y=x$. Find the equation of $f^{-1}(x)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Let } \quad y & =x^{3}+1 \\
x^{3} & =y-1 \quad \ldots \text { get } x \text { in terms of } y \\
x & =\sqrt[3]{y-1} \\
\therefore \quad f^{-1}(x) & =\sqrt[3]{x-1} \quad \ldots \text { change } y \text { to } x
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-254.jpg?height=287&width=381&top_left_y=1304&top_left_x=465)
$f(x)=x^{2}, x \in R$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-254.jpg?height=287&width=371&top_left_y=1304&top_left_x=1003)
$h(x)=x^{2}, x \geqslant 0$
$f(x)=x^{2}, x \in R$ is a function but it is not injective (therefore not bijective) as a horizontal line will intersect the graph more than once. Since it is not bijective, it has no inverse.
$h(x)=x^{2}, x \geqslant 0$ is a function in the restricted domain $x \geqslant 0$.
$h(x)$ is a bijective function and hence has an inverse.
The inverse function $h^{-1}(x)$ is $y=\sqrt{x}$, for $x \geqslant 0$.
If $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are inverse functions, the domain of $f$ is the range of $f^{-1}$.

## Example 3

The relation $f(x)=x^{2}-4 x-4$ is a function with domain $x>2$.
Find $f^{-1}(x)$ and write down its range.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { et } \quad y & =x^{2}-4 x-4 \\
y & =x^{2}-4 x+\left(\frac{4}{2}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{4}{2}\right)^{2}-4 \quad \ldots \text { completing the square } \\
& =x^{2}-4 x+4-4-4 \\
y & =(x-2)^{2}-8 \\
(x-2)^{2} & =y+8 \\
x-2 & =\sqrt{y+8} \\
x & =2+\sqrt{y+8} \quad \text { We } \\
\therefore \quad f^{-1}(x) & =2+\sqrt{x+8} \quad \ldots \text { finding } x \text { in terms of } y
\end{aligned}
$$

We take the positive value for $\sqrt{y+8}$ as $x>2$.

The range of $f^{-1}(x)$ is $y>2$ $\qquad$ the same as the domain of $f$

## Exercise 8.4

2. $f(x)=2 x-3, x \in R$
3. $f(x)=5 x+3, x \in R$

8. $f(x)=\frac{3 x}{x-1}, x \in R, x \neq 1$
9. $f(x)=\frac{10-2 x}{3}, x \in R$
10. Given $f(x)=4 x+5, x \in R$, find $f^{-1}(x)$.

## Section 8.5 Sketching the graphs of functions

In our study of algebra so far, we will have learned how to construct a table of ordered pairs, then plot these points and draw the graph of the function.

In this section, we will show how to draw a rough sketch of a graph by concentrating on the shape of the graph, as well as the main features of the graph.
The important features of any graph include
> the general shape of the graph, e.g. the graph of a quadratic function
> the point(s) where the graph crosses the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis
> the turning points of a quadratic and cubic graph.

## 1. Linear functions

The graph of a line such as $y=2 x-4$ can be drawn by finding the points where the line intersects the $x$-axis and $y$-axis.
When $x=0, y=2(0)-4$, i.e. $y=-4$.
When $y=0,2 x-4=0$, i.e. $x=2$.
$\therefore(0,-4)$ and $(2,0)$ are points on the line.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-257.jpg?height=371&width=310&top_left_y=1290&top_left_x=1250)

## 2. Quadratic functions

The general form of a quadratic function is $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$, where $a, b$ and $c$ are constants and $a \neq 0$.

When $a>0$, the graph of $f(x)$ looks like this:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-257.jpg?height=166&width=199&top_left_y=1949&top_left_x=320)

The lowest point of the curve is called the minimum point.

When $a<0$, the graph of $f(x)$ looks like this:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-257.jpg?height=166&width=195&top_left_y=1951&top_left_x=1008)

The highest point of the curve is called the maximum point.

To draw a rough sketch of a quadratic function, we require
(i) the points where the graph intersects the $x$-axis and $y$-axis
(ii) the turning point of the curve.

The turning point can be found by either of these methods:
(i) expressing the function in completed square form, or
(ii) using calculus. (chapter 4)

Here is an example of how to express a quadratic function in 'completed square' form.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x^{2}-8 x+9 \\
= & \left.x^{2}-8 x+16-16+9 \quad \ldots \text { add and subtract (half the coefficient of } x\right)^{2} \\
= & (x-4)^{2}-7
\end{aligned}
$$

The turning point is $(4,-7)$.
The axis of symmetry is $x=4$.

For the function

$$
y=k(x-p)^{2}+q
$$

$>$ the turning point is $(p, q)$
$>$ the minimum value is $q$.

## Example 1

By finding the points where the curve crosses the $x$-axis and $y$-axis and the turning point by completing the square, sketch the graph of $f(x)=-x^{2}+4 x+5$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& -x^{2}+4 x+5 \\
= & -\left[x^{2}-4 x-5\right] \\
= & \left.-\left[x^{2}-4 x+4-4-5\right] \quad \ldots \text { add and subtract (half the coefficient of } x\right)^{2} \\
= & -\left[(x-2)^{2}-9\right] \\
= & -(x-2)^{2}+9
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad$ The turning point is $(2,9)$.
To find where the curve intersects the $x$-axis, we solve the equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
& -x^{2}+4 x+5=0 \\
\Rightarrow & x^{2}-4 x-5=0 \Rightarrow(x+1)(x-5)=0 \Rightarrow x=-1 \text { or } x=5
\end{aligned}
$$

The curve intersects the $x$-axis at $x=-1$ and at $x=5$.
To find where the curve intersects the $y$-axis, let $x=0$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
y=-x^{2}+4 x+5 \\
x=0 \Rightarrow y=0+0+5, \text { i.e. } 5
\end{gathered}
$$

The curve intersects the $y$-axis at $(0,5)$.
A sketch of the curve is shown.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-258.jpg?height=348&width=456&top_left_y=1705&top_left_x=1085)

Note: In the example above if $f(x)=-x^{2}+4 x+5$ then $f^{\prime}(x)=-2 x+4$
$\therefore$ turning point occurs at $f^{\prime}(x)=0=-2 x+4$
$\therefore \quad x=2$ and $f(2)=-2^{2}+4(2)+5=9 \quad \therefore \quad(2,9)$ is the turning point.

## 3. Cubic functions

A cubic function generally takes the form

$$
f(x)=a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d, \text { where } a, b, c \text { and } d \in R .
$$

The graph of a cubic function $f(x)=a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d$, generally consists of a smooth curve with two turning points as follows:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-259.jpg?height=169&width=482&top_left_y=486&top_left_x=419)

When $a>0$, the graph begins by rising from left to right.

When $a<0$, the graph begins by falling from left to right.

We can sketch a graph of a cubic function by finding the points where the curve intersects the axes. The accuracy of the sketch can be improved by locating the local maximum and minimum turning points if required.

## Example 2

Sketch the graph of $y=x(x+1)(x-2)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y=x(x+1)(x-2) \\
\Rightarrow & y=x^{3}-x^{2}-2 x \\
y= & x(x+1)(x-2) \\
y= & 0 \Rightarrow x(x+1)(x-2)=0 \\
\Rightarrow & x=0, x=-1 \text { or } x=2
\end{aligned}
$$

... The shape of the graph will look like this as the coefficient of $x^{3}$ is positive.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-259.jpg?height=102&width=291&top_left_y=1250&top_left_x=1078)
$\therefore \quad$ The curve crosses the $x$-axis at

$$
x=0, x=-1, x=2 .
$$

We let $x=0$ to find where the curve intersects the $y$-axis.

$$
x=0 \Rightarrow y=0
$$

$\therefore \quad$ The curve crosses the $y$-axis at $(0,0)$.
A sketch of the curve is shown on the right.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-259.jpg?height=357&width=510&top_left_y=1825&top_left_x=1032)

## Example 3

Sketch the graph of $f(x)=-x^{3}-2 x^{2}+5 x+6$.
We first factorise $f(x)$ to find the points where the curve intersects the $x$-axis.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(x)=-x^{3}-2 x^{2}+5 x+6 \\
& f(1)=-1-2+5+6 \neq 0 \\
& f(-1)=1-2-5+6=0 \\
& \therefore(x+1) \text { is a factor of } f(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

By division, $y=(x+1)\left(-x^{2}-x+6\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y=-(x+1)\left(x^{2}+x-6\right) \\
& y=-(x+1)(x+3)(x-2) \\
& x=-1,-3 \text { or } 2 \\
& y=6
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
x=0 \Rightarrow y=6
$$

A sketch of the curve is shown below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-260.jpg?height=321&width=486&top_left_y=523&top_left_x=1011)

The curve has this shape as the coefficient of $x^{3}$ is negative.
$\therefore \quad$ The curve intersects the $y$-axis at $(0,6)$. coefficient of $x^{3}$ is negative.

## Example 4

For the function $f: R \rightarrow R, f(x)=-\frac{x^{3}}{3}+4 x-1$ :
(i) Find the stationary points and determine their nature.
(ii) Sketch the graph.
(i) $f(x)$ has stationary points where $f^{\prime}(x)=0$ :
$f(x)=-\frac{x^{3}}{3}+4 x-1 \Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)=-x^{2}+4=0 \quad \therefore x= \pm 2$.
$f^{\prime \prime}(x)=-2 x \quad \Rightarrow f^{\prime \prime}(2)=-2(2)=-4 \quad$ (negative)
$\Rightarrow$ a maximum turning point at $x=+2$
Also $f^{\prime \prime}(-2)=-2(-2)=+4 \quad($ positive $)$
$\Rightarrow$ a minimum turning point at $x=-2$
At $x=2, f(2)=-\frac{(2)^{3}}{3}+4(2)-1=\frac{13}{3}=4 \frac{1}{3}$
At $x=-2, f(-2)=-\frac{(-2)^{3}}{3}+4(-2)-1=\frac{17}{3}=-6 \frac{1}{3}$
$\Rightarrow$ a maximum turning point at $\left(2, \frac{13}{3}\right)$, a minimum turning point at $\left(-2,-\frac{19}{3}\right)$
(ii) Since $f(x)=-\frac{x^{3}}{3}$ $\qquad$ the curve has the general shape:

At $x=0, f(0)=-1 \quad \therefore(0,-1)$ is a point on the curve.

Also at $f^{\prime \prime}(x)=0$ the curve has a point of inflection.
$\therefore-2 x=0 \Rightarrow x=0$
The point $(0,-1)$ is the point of inflection.

Note: the table function on your calculator can give some extra points if a more accurate sketch is required.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-261.jpg?height=650&width=510&top_left_y=427&top_left_x=1039)

## 4. Finding equations for given cubic graphs

The graph of a function is shown on the right.
It intersects the $x$-axis at $x=-2,0$ and 2 .
This function will contain $x(x+2)(x-2)$ as part of the expression.

Notice that the graph also contains the point $(1,1)$.
To accommodate this condition, the equation of the function will take the form $y=k x(x+2)(x-2)$, where $k$ is a number to be found.

We use the fact that $(1,1)$ is on the graph to find the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-261.jpg?height=474&width=479&top_left_y=1267&top_left_x=1156) value of $k$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
(1,1) \in \text { of the graph: } & y=k x(x+2)(x-2) \\
\Rightarrow & 1=k(1)(3)(-1) \\
\Rightarrow & -3 k=1 \Rightarrow k=-\frac{1}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\therefore \quad$ The equation of the function is $y=-\frac{1}{3} x(x+2)(x-2)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { i.e. } y=-\frac{x}{3}(x+2)(x-2) \\
& \text { or } y=-\frac{1}{3} x^{3}+\frac{4}{3} x
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: If a graph touches (but does not cross) the $x$-axis at a point, a double root occurs at this point. This point can either be a local maximum or minimum turning point.
As in the graph over $f(x)=(x-4)^{2}$
$\Rightarrow$ roots at, $0=(x-4)(x-4)$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-262.jpg?height=310&width=493&top_left_y=170&top_left_x=1135)
$\Rightarrow$ a double root at $x=4$.
We also note that $f^{\prime}(x)=2 x-8$
$\Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)=0$ at $x=4$ i.e. a turning point at $x=4$.

## Example 5

Find the equation of the given graphed function and prove (using calculus) that the function has stationary points at $(2,0)$ and ( 0,2 ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-262.jpg?height=317&width=388&top_left_y=763&top_left_x=1018)

The graph intersects the $x$-axis at $x=-1$ and it touches the $x$-axis at $x=2$.
The equation has the form $y=k(x+1)(x-2)^{2}$
Put $(3,2)$ into the equation: $2=k(4)(1)^{2}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 & =4 k \\
k & =\frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The equation of the function is $y=\frac{1}{2}(x+1)(x-2)^{2}$
$y=\frac{1}{2}(x+1)(x-2)^{2}=\frac{x^{3}}{2}-\frac{3 x^{2}}{2}+2$
$\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\frac{3 x^{2}}{2}-3 x=x\left(\frac{3 x}{2}-3\right)$
at $x=0, y=\frac{1}{2}(1)(2)^{2}=2$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=0=x\left(\frac{3 x}{2}-3\right) \Rightarrow x=0,2$
at $x=2, y=\frac{1}{2}(2+1)(2-2)^{2}=0$
$\therefore$ stationary points occur at $(0,2)$ and $(2,0)$

Note: Stationary points are explained in detail in Chapter 4.

## Section 8.6 Exponential and logarithmic functions

Any function of the form $f(x)=a^{x}$, where the base $a$ is a positive real number other than 1 , is called an exponential function (or index function).
$y=2^{x}$ and $y=10^{x}$ are examples of exponential functions.
The function $f(x)=e^{x}$ is a special exponential function where $e$ is the real number 2.718, correct to three decimal places.
The graph of an exponential function has a very recognizable shape.
Two types of graphs will be examined.

1. Graphs of $y=a^{x}, a>1$

## Example 1

Plot the graph of $y=2^{x}$ for $-3 \leqslant x \leqslant 3$.
The table of values is set out below:

| $\boldsymbol{x}$ | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\boldsymbol{y}=\mathbf{2}^{\boldsymbol{x}}$ | 0.125 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 |

The graph is shown on the right.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-266.jpg?height=310&width=434&top_left_y=1872&top_left_x=1096)

The graph above shows that as $x$ decreases in value, the curve approaches the $x$-axis but never touches it. The $x$-axis is said to be an asymptote to the curve.

The graph intersects the $y$-axis at $(0,1)$.
The range of the function is $R^{+}$, i.e. the range is $y>0$.

All graphs of the form $y=a^{x}$ intersect the $y$-axis at $(0,1)$.

Graphs of $y=2^{x}, y=3^{x}$ and $y=4^{x}$ are drawn on the same diagram, as shown.

The larger the value of $x$, the steeper the rise in the curve.

Each curve crosses the $y$-axis at $(0,1)$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-267.jpg?height=501&width=489&top_left_y=523&top_left_x=1142)
2. Graphs of $y=a^{x}, 0<a<1$

## Example 2

Plot the graph of $y=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x}$ in the domain $-3 \leqslant x \leqslant 3$.

Here is the table of values:

| $\boldsymbol{x}$ | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\boldsymbol{y}=\left(\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2}}\right)^{\boldsymbol{x}}=\mathbf{2}^{-\boldsymbol{x}}$ | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 0.5 | 0.25 | 0.125 |

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-267.jpg?height=310&width=430&top_left_y=1212&top_left_x=1124)

In the graph shown on the previous page, the $y$-values decrease as the $x$-values increase. The graph contains the point $(0,1)$.
The range of the function is $R^{+}$.
The graph of $y=2^{-x}$ is a reflection in the $y$-axis of the graph of $y=2^{+x}$.

Graphs of Exponential Functions
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-267.jpg?height=338&width=869&top_left_y=1858&top_left_x=645)

On the right is the graph of $y=3.2^{x}$.
It is similar to the graph of $y=2^{x}$, but each $y$-value is multiplied by 3 .
Notice that this graph intersects the $y$-axis at $(0,3)$.
In general, the graph of $y=k \cdot 2^{x}$ intersects the $y$-axis at $(0, k)$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-268.jpg?height=402&width=411&top_left_y=176&top_left_x=1221)

## Graphing logarithmic functions

A table of values for $y=\log _{10} x$ is given below.
The values are given to 1 decimal place.

| $\boldsymbol{x}$ | 0.1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{\operatorname { l o g }}_{\mathbf{1 0}} \boldsymbol{x}$ | -1 | 0 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 0.7 |

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-268.jpg?height=461&width=579&top_left_y=880&top_left_x=210)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-268.jpg?height=380&width=442&top_left_y=951&top_left_x=958)

The graph of $y=\log _{10} x$ is the reflection in the line $y=x$ of the graph of $y=10^{x}$.
The diagram on the right above illustrates that the inverse of the exponential function $y=\mathrm{e}^{x}$ is the logarithmic function $y=\log _{\mathrm{e}} x$.
$\log _{\mathrm{e}} x$ is generally written as $\ln x$.
The function $y=e^{x}$ has the inverse function $y=\ln x$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-268.jpg?height=421&width=449&top_left_y=1718&top_left_x=209)
$>$ the graphs are reflections of each other in the line $y=x$
> $y=e^{x}$ has the $x$-axis as an asymptote
> $y=\ln x$ has the $y$-axis as an asymptote
$>$ for $y=e^{x}$, the domain is $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and the range is $y \in \mathbb{R}, y>0$
$>$ for $y=\ln x$, the domain is $x \in \mathbb{R}, x>0$ and the range is $y \in \mathbb{R}$
> $e^{x}$ is positive for all values of $x$
$>\ln x$ does not exist for negative values of $x$.

Note: The inverse of the function $f(x)=e^{x}$ may also be found algebraically as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y=e^{x} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad x=\log _{e} y \quad \ldots \text { using the definition of a log. } \\
& x=\ln y \quad \ldots \log _{e}=\ln \\
& \therefore \quad \boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{f}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{x})=\ln \boldsymbol{x} \quad \ldots \text { changing } y \text { to } x \text { and } x \text { to } y \\
& \text { where } y=f^{-1}(x) \text { the inverse function } \\
& \therefore \quad \text { if } y=f(x)=e^{x} \text { then } f^{-1}(x)=\ln x \\
& \text { If } y=f(x)=e^{x} \\
& \text { then } f^{-1}(x)=\ln x
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 3

The graph of the function $f(x)=a \cdot b^{x}$ is shown. Find the values of $a$ and $b$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(x)=a \cdot b^{x} \\
& f(0)=3 \Rightarrow a \cdot b^{0}=3 \\
& \quad \Rightarrow a=3 \quad \ldots b^{0}=1 \\
& (1,6) \in f(x) \\
& \Rightarrow 6=3 \cdot b^{1} \\
& \Rightarrow 3 b=6 \Rightarrow b=2 \\
& \therefore \quad a=3 \text { and } b=2
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 4

The size of the human population, $N$, can be modelled using the equation $N=N_{0} e^{r t}$ where $N_{0}$ is the population in 2006, $t$ is the time in years since 2006, and $r$ is the annual rate of increase in the population.
(i) In 2006, the population of a certain country was approximately 61 million, with an annual rate of increase of $1.6 \%$. Assuming this growth remains constant, what would be the population in 2020 ? (i.e. after 14 years.)
(ii) In 2006, the population of another country was approximately 5.1 million, with an annual rate of increase of $0.43 \%$.
Assuming this growth rate remains constant, how long would it take for this country's population to double in size?
(i) $N=N_{0} e^{r t}$
$N=61000000 e^{0.016(14)} \quad \ldots$ express $1.6 \%$ as a decimal (i.e. 0.016)
$N=61000000 e^{0.224}$
$N=61000000(1.25107)$
$N=76,315,270$
$\therefore$ the population in 2020 will be 76.3 million
(ii) $N=N_{0} e^{r t}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 10.2=5.1 e^{0.0043 t} \quad \ldots r=0.43 \%=\frac{0.43}{100}=0.0043 \quad\left[N=2 N_{0}\right] \\
& e^{0.0043 t}=\frac{10.2}{5.1}=2 \\
& \Rightarrow 0.0043 t=\log _{e} 2=\ln 2 \quad \ldots \text { using the definition of a log. } \\
& \therefore \quad t=\frac{\ln 2}{0.0043}=161.197=161.2 \text { years. }
\end{aligned}
$$

It will take 161.2 years for the population to double in size.

## Section 8.7 Related graphs

In previous sections of this chapter, we dealt with a variety of functions as well as the graphs of these functions.

In this section, we will examine how changes to the equation of a function affect the graph of the function. We will confine our discussion to four basic changes.

1. $y=f(x) \pm a$

The function $f(x)=x^{2}$ is shown.
The function $f(x)+2$ represents a translation vertically upwards by 2 units.

The function $f(x)-3$ represents a translation vertically downwards by 3 units.
> $+a$ moves the graph in the positive $y$-direction
> $-a$ moves the graph in the negative $y$-direction

2. $y=f(x \pm a)$

The three graphs on the right show that $y=f(x+2)$ represents a translation of the function $f(x)=x^{2}$ by minus 2 units parallel to the $x$-axis.
$f(x)=(x-3)^{2}$ represents a

> $y=f(x+a)$ results in translating the graph parallel to the $x$-axis by $-a$ units
> $y=f(x-a)$ results in translating the graph parallel to the $x$-axis by $+a$ units
3. $y=-f(x)$

The graph of $y=-f(x)$ is a reflection in the $x$-axis of the graph of $y=f(x)$.
> The graph of $y=f(-x)$ is a reflection in the $y$-axis of the graph of $y=f(x)$.

4. $y=a f(x)$

The graphs of

$$
f(x)=x(x-1)(x+2)
$$

and $f(x)=3 x(x-1)(x+2)$ are shown.

Multiplying a function by a constant will not change the points where the graph intersects the $x$-axis but it does have the effect of stretching the graph up and down.

## Section 9.1 Scatter diagrams

A scatter graph or scatter diagram is a graph consisting of points plotted on an $x-y$ plane. Each point represents the values of two different variables such as the heights and weights of different individuals. Such data connecting two variables is called bivariate data.

After plotting the points on a scatter graph, we look for a pattern, particularly a linear pattern. If the points on a scatter graph lie approximately on a straight line, we say that there is a linear relationship between the two sets of data. The closer the points are to a straight line, the stronger the relationship will be.

The table below shows the average temperature and the number of ice-creams sold by a shop over a 12-day period.

| Average temperature $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}\right)$ | 10 | 12 | 16 | 20 | 13 | 16 | 14 | 17 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 16 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| No. of ice-creams sold | 1 | 5 | 20 | 50 | 15 | 25 | 14 | 30 | 32 | 42 | 50 | 30 |

Using the horizontal axis for the temperature and the vertical axis for the numbers of icecreams sold, we get the following scatter graph.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-286.jpg?height=420&width=1010&top_left_y=1650&top_left_x=417)

The scatter graph shows that the number of ice-creams sold increases as the temperature increases. Since the points lie close to a straight line, we say that there is a linear relationship between the two sets of data.

## Correlation

Correlation is the strength of a relationship between two variables, say $x$ and $y$. We say $x$ and $y$ are correlated if a scatter graph shows a linear pattern to the plotted points $(x, y)$. If no pattern exists, the variables are not correlated.

The three diagrams below illustrate positive correlation, negative correlation and no correlation.

The variables $x$ and $y$ have a positive correlation if $y$ increases as $x$ increases.

The variables $x$ and $y$ have a negative correlation if $y$ decreases as $x$ increases.

The variables $x$ and $y$ show no linear pattern.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-287.jpg?height=348&width=430&top_left_y=590&top_left_x=1178)

No correlation

The correlation is high if the points are close to a straight line.
The correlation is low if the points are more spread out.
It is possible to have strong and weak positive correlations as well as strong and weak negative correlations.
The scatter diagrams below illustrate these possibilities:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-287.jpg?height=397&width=1425&top_left_y=1287&top_left_x=209)

## Example 1

The table shows the weights and heights of 12 people.

| Height (cm) | 150 | 152 | 155 | 158 | 158 | 160 | 163 | 165 | 170 | 175 | 178 | 180 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Weight (kg) | 57 | 62 | 63 | 64 | 58 | 62 | 65 | 66 | 65 | 70 | 66 | 67 |

(i) Draw a scatter graph to show this data.
(ii) Describe the strength and type of correlation between these heights and weights.
(i) We draw two axes at right angles.

We put the heights on the horizontal axis.
We start with 140 cm and go up to 180 cm .
We put the weights on the vertical axis, starting at 55 kg and going up to 70 kg . We then plot the points $(150,57),(152,62), \ldots$ etc.
The scatter graph is shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-288.jpg?height=562&width=737&top_left_y=509&top_left_x=579)
(ii) The correlation is weak positive as the points do not lie very close to a straight line. The correlation is positive because the weight generally increases as the height increases.

## Causal relationships and correlation

The price of a used car depends, among other things, on the age of the car. The age of the car causes the price of the car to decrease. We say that there is a causal relationship between the age of the car and the price of the car.

Definition
When a change in one variable causes a change in another variable, we say that there is a causal relationship between them.

The scatter graph shows the relationship between the sales of iced drinks and temperature. The correlation is strong and positive. You would expect this as a rise in temperature would tend to result in an increase in the sales of iced drinks.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-288.jpg?height=456&width=772&top_left_y=1776&top_left_x=863)

It would therefore be reasonable to conclude that there is a causal relationship between the increase in temperature and the sales of ice creams.

The scatter diagram below shows the number of iPads and the number of fridges sold by an electrical shop over a ten-month period.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-289.jpg?height=406&width=751&top_left_y=417&top_left_x=546)

The graph shows that there is a reasonably strong positive correlation between the number of iPads sold and the number of fridges sold. However, this does not mean that there is a causal relationship between them; buying an iPad does not cause you to buy a fridge.

Correlation does not necessarily mean that there is a causal relationship.

## Section 9.2 Measuring correlation - Line of best fit

## 1. Calculating the correlation coefficient

Correlation is the strength of a relationship between two sets of data.
The numerical measure of this property is called the correlation coefficient and is denoted by the letter $r$.
The value of $r$ will always lie between -1 and 1 .
$r=0$ indicates no correlation.
$r=1$ indicates perfect positive linear correlation.
$r=-1$ indicates perfect negative linear correlation.
Here are some examples of the value of $r$ :
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-292.jpg?height=258&width=234&top_left_y=710&top_left_x=213)

Perfect positive correlation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-292.jpg?height=258&width=239&top_left_y=710&top_left_x=503)

Perfect negative correlation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-292.jpg?height=258&width=239&top_left_y=710&top_left_x=800)

Some positive correlation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-292.jpg?height=258&width=236&top_left_y=710&top_left_x=1096)

No correlation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-292.jpg?height=258&width=239&top_left_y=710&top_left_x=1389)

Strong negative correlation

The nearer the value of $r$ is to 1 or -1 , the closer the points on the scatter diagram are to a straight line.
There are several methods of calculating a correlation coefficient.
The method selected for our course is called the product-moment correlation coefficient, $\boldsymbol{r}$. The formula that is used to find this coefficient involves a lot of tedious calculations.

For our course, it is recommended that we use the electronic calculator to find the value of $r$. The steps involved in the input of data and finding the value of $r$ are given in Appendix 1 at the end of the book.

## 2. The line of best fit

We have already stated that when points on a scatter diagram lie on, or close to, a straight line a strong correlation exists.
To draw the line that fits best through the points you should aim to have the points evenly spread on either side of the line.
This scatter diagram shows the average daytime temperature plotted against the number of ice-creams sold.

A line that is drawn to pass as close as possible to all the plotted points on a scatter diagram is called the line of best fit.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-292.jpg?height=453&width=751&top_left_y=1730&top_left_x=881)

The line drawn is called the line of best fit.
It can go through some, all or none of the points.
This line shows the general trend of the relationship between the two sets of data. The line can be used to estimate other values. However, estimating values where the line has been extended beyond the existing points is less reliable.

## Example 1

The table below shows the number of hours of sunshine and the maximum temperature in ten Irish towns on a particular day.

| Maximum temperature $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}\right)$ | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Hours of sunshine | 9.6 | 11.6 | 10.2 | 13.25 | 11.8 | 13.6 |  | 15.4 | 15.2 | 15 |

(i) Plot a scatter diagram and draw a line of best fit for the data.
(ii) Use your line of best fit to estimate the number of hours of sunshine when the maximum temperature was $18^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
(iii) Describe the correlation shown in your diagram.
(iv) Use your calculator to find the correlation coefficient.
(i) The scatter diagram and line of best fit are shown below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-293.jpg?height=644&width=814&top_left_y=1130&top_left_x=550)
(ii) The dotted lines on the diagram show that there are 14 hours of sunshine when the temperature is $18^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
(iii) The diagram shows that there is strong positive correlation between the two sets of data.
(iv) The correlation coefficient, by calculator, is 0.9176 .

## 3. Finding the equation of the line of best fit

From our knowledge of coordinate geometry, we should be familiar with the equation of a line in the form $y=m x+c$.
In statistics it is more usual to use the form (in the calculator), $y=\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B} x$
The equation, $y=\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B} x$ has a gradient (slope) of B and its intercept on the $y$ axis is ( $0, \mathrm{~A}$ )
Thus to find the equation of a line of best fit drawn by eye,
(i) find two points on the line and use these points to find the slope of the line.
(ii) Use the slope found and one of the points to find the equation of the line using

$$
y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right) .
$$

(iii) Express the equation in the form $y=\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B} x$.

## Example 2

This scatter diagram shows the results of a scientific experiment involving two variables $x$ and $y$.
(i) Find the equation of the line of best fit.
(ii) Assuming that this line is valid for larger values of $x$, find the value of $y$ when $x=52$.
(i) $(15,10)$ and $(25,15)$ are two points
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-294.jpg?height=432&width=583&top_left_y=911&top_left_x=958) on the line.

Slope $m=\frac{15-10}{25-15}=\frac{5}{10}=\frac{1}{2}$
Equation of line: $\quad y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right)$
$y-10=\frac{1}{2}(x-15) \ldots(15,10)$ is a point on the line

$$
\Rightarrow 2 y-20=x-15
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \quad y=\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{5}{2}
$$

The equation of the line of best fit is $y=\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{5}{2}$.
(ii) We use the equation $y=\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{5}{2}$ to find the value of $y$ when $x=52$.
$x=52 \Rightarrow y=\frac{1}{2}(52)+\frac{5}{2}$, i.e., $y=28 \frac{1}{2}$
Thus $y=28 \frac{1}{2}$ when $x=52$.

## Example 3

The table below shows the weights and heights of 12 pupils.

| Height (cm) | 150 | 152 | 155 | 158 | 158 | 160 | 163 | 165 | 170 | 175 | 178 | 180 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Weight (kg) | 57 | 62 | 63 | 64 | 58 | 62 | 65 | 66 | 66.5 | 70 | 66 | 67 |

(i) Draw a scatter diagram to show this data.
(ii) Describe the strength and type of correlation between these heights and weights.
(iii) Draw a line of best fit on your scatter diagram.
(iv) Tony is 162 cm tall.

(v) Use your calculator to find the correlation coefficient, correct to two decimal places.
(vi) Find the equation of the line of best fit in the form $y=a x+b$.
(i) The scatter diagram and line of best fit are shown below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-295.jpg?height=442&width=739&top_left_y=925&top_left_x=588)
(ii) Strong positive correlation.
(iv) Draw a line from 162 cm on the height axis to meet your line of best fit.

Now draw a horizontal line and read off the value where it meets the weight axis.
Tony's probable weight is about 63 kg .
(v) By calculator, the correlation coefficient is 0.8 .
(vi) Two points on the line are $(175,67)$ and $(155,61)$

Slope of the line $=\frac{67-61}{175-155}=\frac{6}{20}=\frac{3}{10}$
Equation of the line: $y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
y-61 & =\frac{3}{10}(x-155) \\
y & =\frac{3}{10} x-\frac{3 \times 155}{10}+61 \\
y & =\frac{3}{10} x+\frac{29}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Section 9.3 The normal distribution

When the physical characteristics, such as height or weight, of a large number of individuals are arranged in order, from lowest to highest, in a frequency distribution, the same pattern shows up repeatedly. This pattern shows that large numbers cluster near the middle of the distribution, as illustrated by the symmetrical histogram shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-299.jpg?height=404&width=555&top_left_y=439&top_left_x=642)

If the distribution is very large and continuous, and the class intervals become sufficiently small, the distribution forms a symmetrical bell-shaped smooth curve called the curve of normal distribution or simply the normal curve as shown on the following page:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-299.jpg?height=371&width=1533&top_left_y=1007&top_left_x=153)

The normal distribution is the most important continuous distribution in statistics.
The curve on the right shows a normal distribution with mean $\mu$.
The red line is the axis of symmetry.
The mode, median and mean are all equal. They lie on the axis of symmetry.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-299.jpg?height=347&width=635&top_left_y=1472&top_left_x=993)

All normal distributions will have a mean ( $\mu$ ) and standard deviation ( $\sigma$ ).
Different values for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ will give different normal distributions.
The diagram on the right shows two normal distributions with the same mean but different standard deviations.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-299.jpg?height=317&width=937&top_left_y=1942&top_left_x=691)

This diagram shows two normal distributions with the same standard deviation but different means.

## Empirical Rule

All normal distributions share some very important characteristics.

1. About $68 \%$ of all the values of any normal distribution lie within one standard deviation of the mean, i.e., in the range $[\mu-\sigma$ and $\mu+\sigma]$.
$34 \%$ lie to the right of the mean. $34 \%$ lie to the left of the mean.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-300.jpg?height=376&width=607&top_left_y=656&top_left_x=1021)
2. About $95 \%$ of all values lie within two standard deviations of the mean, i.e., in the range $[\mu-2 \sigma$ and $\mu+2 \sigma]$. $47 \frac{1}{2} \%$ lie to the right of the mean. $47 \frac{1}{2} \%$ lie to the left of the mean.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-300.jpg?height=375&width=607&top_left_y=1062&top_left_x=1021)
3. Almost all ( $99.7 \%$ ) of the values lie within three standard deviations of the mean.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-300.jpg?height=378&width=650&top_left_y=1461&top_left_x=981)

The three characteristics of the normal distribution listed above are generally known as The Empirical Rule.
This rule is highlighted below.

- Approximately $68 \%$ of a normal distribution lie within

The Empirical Rule one standard deviation of the mean

- $95 \%$ lie within two standard deviations of the mean
- $99.7 \%$ lie within three standard deviations of the mean.


## Example 1

The marks, out of 100, in an examination are normally distributed.
The mean mark is 60 and the standard deviation is 6 marks.
(i) Work out the mark that is two standard deviations above the mean.
(ii) What percentage of the marks lie between 48 and 72 marks?
(iii) What percentage of the marks lie between 60 and 72 marks?
(iv) If 1000 students took the examination, how many students scored less than 54 marks?
(i) The mark that is two standard deviations above the mean is:

$$
\text { mean }+ \text { twice standard deviation }=60+2(6)=72 \text { marks. }
$$

(ii) $48=60-12=\mu-2 \sigma$ and $72=60+12=\mu+2 \sigma$

There are $95 \%$ of all values in the range $[\mu-2 \sigma$ and $\mu+2 \sigma]$.
$\therefore 95 \%$ of the marks lie between 48 and 72 .
(iii) $60=\mu \quad$ and $\quad 72=60+12=\mu+2 \sigma$

Since $95 \%$ of the marks lie between $\mu-2 \sigma$ and $\mu+2 \sigma$, $\frac{1}{2}(95 \%)$, i.e. $47 \frac{1}{2} \%$, lie between $\mu$ and $\mu+2 \sigma$.
Thus, $47 \frac{1}{2} \%$ lie between 60 and 72 marks.
(iv) $54=60-6=\mu-\sigma$

From the curve, $34 \%$ of the marks lie between $\mu$ and $\mu-\sigma$.
$\therefore 50 \%-34 \%=16 \%$
$\therefore 16 \%$ are less than $\mu-\sigma$, i.e., less than 54 marks.
$16 \%$ of $1000=160$
Therefore 160 students scored less than 54 marks.

## Example 2

Bottles of 300 ml shampoo are filled with the amounts in the bottles normally distributed with a mean of 300 ml and a standard deviation of 3 ml .
If 10000 bottles are filled, how many bottles contain amounts that are
(i) within one standard deviation of the mean?
(ii) more than two standard deviations above the mean?
(iii) If the manufacturer rejects bottles that contain amounts more than 3 standard deviations from the mean, what is the largest amount of shampoo in a bottle you would find for sale?
(i) $68 \%$ of the bottles lie within one standard deviation of the mean.
$68 \%$ of $10000=6800$.
$\therefore 6800$ bottles lie within one standard deviation of the mean.
(ii) $95 \%$ of the bottles lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
$\frac{1}{2}$ of $95 \%$, i.e. $47 \frac{1}{2} \%$, lie within 2 standard deviations above the mean.
$\therefore 50 \%-47 \frac{1}{2} \%$, i.e. $2 \frac{1}{2} \%$, lie more than two standard deviations above the mean.
$2 \frac{1}{2} \%$ of $10000=250$.
250 bottles are more than 2 standard deviations above the mean.
(iii) 3 standard deviations above the mean is $300+3(3)=309$.

Therefore, 309 ml is the largest amount you would find in a bottle.

Note: The Empirical Rule gives a rough approximation of percentages of data lying within a number of standard deviations of the mean. A far more accurate method, involving $z$-tables, will be seen in the next section.

## Standard scores (z-scores)

In a state examination, Karen got $72 \%$ in her English examination and $68 \%$ in her Maths examination. In which examination did she achieve the better result? To determine this, we would need to know the average mark and standard deviation for each subject. We would then need to find the number of standard deviations Karen's mark was above or below the mean in each subject. If her mark was 1 standard deviation above the mean in English and 0.75 standard deviations above the mean in Maths, then Karen would have done relatively better in her English examination.

The number of standard deviations that a value lies above or below the mean is called a standard score or $\boldsymbol{z}$-score.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-302.jpg?height=435&width=897&top_left_y=1409&top_left_x=737)

In general, if $x$ is a measurement belonging to a set of data with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, then its value in $z$-units is given below:

$$
z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}, \text { where } \quad \begin{aligned}
& x \text { is the score or value } \\
& \mu \text { is the mean } \\
& \sigma \text { is the standard deviation }
\end{aligned}
$$

Standard scores are especially useful for dealing with normal distributions.

## Example 3

Simon and Susan did a test in French and a test in Science.
Both tests had a maximum mark of 100 . The results are given in the table below:

|  | Susan's mark | Simon's mark | Mean mark | Standard deviation |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| French | 75 | 50 | 60 | 10 |
| Science | 65 | 40 | 50 | 5 |

Work out the $z$-scores for each subject and comment on the performance of Simon and Susan.

Susan: $z$-score in French $=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}=\frac{75-60}{10}=\frac{15}{10}=1.5$
$z$-score in Science $=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}=\frac{65-50}{5}=\frac{15}{5}=3$
Simon: $z$-score in French $=\frac{50-60}{10}=\frac{-10}{10}=-1$
$z$-score in Science $=\frac{40-50}{5}=\frac{-10}{5}=-2$
Overall, Susan did better as her standard scores were 1.5 and 3 above the mean.
Each of Simon's scores was below the mean.
The 'best' mark was Susan's Science mark because it had the highest standard score.
The 'worst' mark was Simon's Science mark because it had the lowest standard score.

## Section 9.4 Normal Probability Distributions

A probability distribution is similar to a frequency distribution, and also has a mean and a standard deviation.

For a continuous random variable, $X$, the probability that $X$ lies between $a$ and $b$, i.e. $P(a \leqslant X \leqslant b)$, is given by the area under the curve between $a$ and $b$.

From the theory of probability the area under
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-307.jpg?height=402&width=684&top_left_y=247&top_left_x=945) the entire curve is always 1 .

A probability distribution can be normally distributed, just like a frequency distribution. A probability distribution that has the distinctive bell shape is called a normal probability distribution.

## Standard Normal Distribution (Z Distribution)

There are many different normal probability distributions, with different means and different standard deviations.

The most important normal probability distribution, for many reasons, is the so-called standard normal probability distribution. This has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 . It is also called the $Z$ distribution.

The area between the standard normal curve and the $Z$-axis is 1 .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-307.jpg?height=333&width=657&top_left_y=1295&top_left_x=591)

Pages (36-37) of formulae and tables gives the area under the curve as far as a particular value of $Z$.

The shaded area in the diagram above represents the probability that $Z \leqslant 1.2$.
However, since the curve is symmetrical about the line $Z=0$, the tables allow us to find the area under the curve for any value of $Z$.

The method of finding various areas under the curve are shown below:
$\boldsymbol{P}(Z \leqslant \mathbf{1 . 6 8})$ can be read directly from the tables.

$$
P(Z \leqslant 1.68)=0.9535
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-308.jpg?height=331&width=776&top_left_y=238&top_left_x=852)
$\boldsymbol{P}(Z \geqslant \mathbf{0 . 8 5})$
To find the area to the right of 0.85 use the equation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Z \geqslant 0.85) & =1-P(Z \leqslant 0.85) \\
& =1-0.8023 \\
& =0.1977
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-308.jpg?height=329&width=776&top_left_y=623&top_left_x=852)
$P(Z \leqslant-1.23)$
To find the area left of -1.23 , we use the fact that the curve is symmetrical and find the area to the right of 1.23
i.e.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Z \leqslant-1.23) & =1-P(Z \leqslant 1.23) \\
& =1-0.8907 \\
& =0.1093
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-308.jpg?height=329&width=774&top_left_y=1005&top_left_x=855)
$\boldsymbol{P}(\boldsymbol{-} \mathbf{1 . 2 1} \leqslant Z \leqslant \mathbf{0 . 9 3})$
To find this area
(i) find area to the left of 0.93
(ii) find area to the left of -1.21 .

Then subtract (ii) from (i)
For example,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-308.jpg?height=333&width=776&top_left_y=1408&top_left_x=852)

Area to the left of $0.93=0.8238$
Area to the left of $-1.21=1-P(Z \leqslant 1.21)$

$$
=1-0.8869=0.1131
$$

$\Rightarrow$ area of shaded portion $=0.8238-0.1131$

$$
=0.7107
$$

If we are given the probability that $Z \leqslant k$, we can still use the tables to find the value of $Z$ that corresponds to $k$.

The following example illustrates this.

## Example 1

Find $a$ in each of the following:
(i) $P(Z \leqslant a)=0.7324$
(ii) $P(Z \leqslant a)=0.1724$
(i) The area to the left of $z=0$ is 0.5 .

Thus $P(Z \leqslant a)=0.7324 \Rightarrow a$ is positive
From the tables, $0.7324 \Rightarrow a=0.62$
(ii) $P(Z \leqslant a)=0.1724 \Rightarrow a$ is negative

Thus $P(Z \leqslant-a)=1-P(Z \leqslant a)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =1-0.1724 \\
& =0.8276 \\
a & =0.94
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad-a=0.94 \\
& \Rightarrow \quad a=-0.94
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-309.jpg?height=232&width=781&top_left_y=695&top_left_x=760)

## Other Normal Distributions

Suppose a random variable $X$ which is normally distributed has a mean of $\mu$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma$. The standard normal tables ( $Z$ tables) can be used to find probabilities connected with $X$.

This is done by converting values of $X$ into the corresponding $Z$ values. The formula for converting from the given ( $x$ - units) into $z$ - units is given below.

Standard scores

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} & \begin{array}{l}
>x \text { is the given score or variable } \\
>\mu \text { is the given mean }
\end{array} \\
>\sigma \text { is the given standard deviation }
\end{array}
$$

Thus for example to calculate $P\left(X \leqslant x_{1}\right)$ :
(i) calculate $z_{1}=\frac{x_{1}-\mu}{\sigma}$, for a given $x_{1}, \mu$ and $\sigma$.
(ii) then $P\left(X \leqslant x_{1}\right)=P\left(Z \leqslant z_{1}\right)$

## Example 2

The mean height of all the students in a certain school is 175 cm and the standard deviation is 15 cm . If a student is selected at random, find the probability that he is less than, or equal to, 190 cm tall.

If $90 \%$ of the students are less than or equal to $x \mathrm{~cm}$, find the value of $x$, assuming that the distribution is normal.

In the given distribution, $\mu=175$ and $\sigma=15$
Using the formula $\quad z_{1}=\frac{x_{1}-\mu}{\sigma}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x_{1}=190 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z_{1}=\frac{190-175}{15}=1 \\
& \begin{aligned}
\Rightarrow P(X \leqslant 190) & =P(Z \leqslant 1) \\
& =0.8413
\end{aligned} \\
& \Rightarrow P(\text { student } \leqslant 190 \mathrm{~cm})=0.8413
\end{aligned}
$$

If $90 \%$ of the students are less than or equal to $x \mathrm{~cm}$, we need to find the value of $z_{1}$ in the diagram on the right.

From the tables on page 36,

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Z & \left.\leqslant z_{1}\right)=0.9 \\
& \Rightarrow z_{1}=1.28
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-310.jpg?height=216&width=793&top_left_y=710&top_left_x=754)

To find the value for $x$, we must "transform back" by expressing $x$ in terms of $z$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \Rightarrow x & =z \sigma+\mu \\
& =1.28(15)+175=194.2
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore $90 \%$ of the students are less than or equal to 194.2 cm .

## Section 10.1 Confidence interval for population proportion

## 1. Margin of error and confidence intervals

When dealing with sampling in Statistics 1, it was stated that the purpose of sampling is to gain information about the whole population by surveying a small part of the population. If data from a sample is collected in a proper way, then the sample survey can give an accurate indication of the population characteristic that is being studied.
Before a general election, a national newspaper generally requests a market research company to survey a sample of the electorate regarding their voting intentions in the election. The number surveyed is generally about 1000 .

The result of the survey might appear in the daily newspaper as follows:

## 40\% support for The Democratic Right.

The $\mathbf{4 0 \%}$ support is called the sample proportion, that is, the part or portion of the sample who indicated that they would vote for The Democratic Right.
A sample proportion is used to give an estimate of the population proportion who intend to vote for The Democratic Right.

The notation $\hat{\boldsymbol{p}}$ is used to denote sample proportion.
The notation $\boldsymbol{p}$ is used to represent population proportion.
Since $p$ is generally not known, $\hat{p}$ is used as an estimator for the true population proportion, $p$.
Of course everybody knows that sample surveys are not always $100 \%$ accurate. There is generally some 'element of chance' or error involved.

The newspaper might add to their headline the following sentence:

The margin of error is $3 \%$.

The margin of error of $3 \%$ is a way of saying that the result of the survey is $40 \% \pm \mathbf{3} \%$. That means that the research company is quite 'confident' that the proportion of the whole electorate who intend to vote for The Democratic Right could be anywhere between 37\% and $43 \%$.

The expressions for the margin of error, $E$, depend on how confident we want to be of where the population proportion lies. In the work that follows, we examine the margin of error at the $95 \%$ confidence level, i.e. the interval in which $95 \%$ of the samples will lie.
The result of the opinion poll above was given as $40 \% \pm 3 \%$.
That could be written as $37 \%<p<43 \%$, where $p$ is the population proportion. $37 \%<p<43 \%$ is called the confidence interval.

The 'confidence' level is pitched at $95 \%$.
The $95 \%$ confidence implies that the interval was obtained by a method which 'works $95 \%$ of the time'.

The confidence interval, $37 \%<p<43 \%$, is a way of stating that if you surveyed many samples of 1000 people on the same day, the results would be in the interval $37 \%$ to $43 \%$ in $95 \%$ of the samples.

In general, if $\hat{p}$ is a sample proportion for a population proportion, $p$, then the confidence interval for $p$ is given by

$$
\hat{p}-E<p<\hat{p}+E
$$

where $E$ is the margin of error.

## 2. Confidence interval using the margin of error approximation

At the $95 \%$ confidence level, the margin of error, $E$, can be found by using the margin of error approximation:
$E=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, where $n$ is the size of the sample.
For example, if the sample size is 1000 , then $E=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1000}} \approx 0.03 \approx 3 \%$.

Margin of Error Approximation

$$
E=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

If the sample $\operatorname{size}(n)$ is increased, the margin of error, $E$, is reduced.
Using this expression for the margin of error, $E$, the $95 \%$ confidence interval for $p$, the population proportion, is given over.

95\% Confidence Interval
(using the margin of error approximation)

$$
\begin{gathered}
\hat{p}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}<p<\hat{p}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \\
\text { or } \hat{p} \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note: The margin of error approximation, $E=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, only applies at the $95 \%$ level of confidence. Since it can be quite inaccurate, it should only be used if requested to do so.

Note: In calculations, $p, \hat{p}$ and $E$ are always expressed in decimal form.
E.g. if 150 television viewers are interviewed in a sample survey and 63 say they like a new talk show, then the sample proportion is $\hat{p}=\frac{63}{150}=0.42$.

## Example 1

What sample size would be required to have a margin of error of
(i) 0.05
(ii) $2 \frac{1}{2} \%$ ?
(You may use the margin of error approximation)
(i) $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}=0.05$
(ii) $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}=2 \frac{1}{2} \%=0.025$
$\therefore \frac{1}{n}=(0.05)^{2}$
$\frac{1}{n}=(0.025)^{2}$
$\therefore n=\frac{1}{(0.05)^{2}}$
$n=\frac{1}{(0.025)^{2}}$
$n=400$
$n=1600$

## Example 2

A random sample of 400 persons are given a flu vaccine and 136 of them experienced some discomfort.
Construct a $95 \%$ confidence interval for $p$, the population proportion who might experience discomfort. (You may use the margin of error approximation)
The sample proportion $\hat{p}=\frac{136}{400}=0.34$
The margin of error $=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{400}}=\frac{1}{20}=0.05$
The confidence interval is $0.34-0.05<p<0.34+0.05$

$$
=0.29<p<0.39
$$

## Example 3

A survey of 100 residents of a Dublin suburb were asked if they remembered seeing an advertisement for McCain's chips on television. 60 respondents said that they had.
(i) Calculate the sample proportion, $\hat{p}$.
(ii) Find the margin of error, $E$, using the margin of error approximation.
(iii) Construct a $95 \%$ confidence interval for $p$.
(i) $\hat{p}=\frac{60}{100}=0.6$
(ii) $E=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{100}}=\frac{1}{10}=0.1$
(iii) Confidence interval: $\hat{p}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}<p<\hat{p}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
0.6-0.1 & <p<0.6+0.1 \\
0.5 & <p<0.7 \\
\text { or } 50 \% & <p<70 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: The confidence interval is very large here because the sample was small.
A sample of 100 has a margin of error of $10 \%$.
A sample of 1000 has a margin of error of $3 \%$.

## 3. Margin of error using the standard normal tables

If many samples of the same size are taken from a population, each sample will produce a different (but similar) proportion. All these proportions form their own distribution called the sampling distribution of the proportion.

The standard error, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\hat{p}}$, of this distribution is given on page 34 of Formulae and Tables and is shown on the right.

$$
\sigma_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}
$$

Since $\boldsymbol{p}$, the population proportion, is generally not known, $\hat{\boldsymbol{p}}$, the sample proportion, is used as an estimator for the population proportion.

In this section we will use the Standard Normal Tables (rather than the margin of error, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ ) to get a more accurate confidence interval for a population proportion.

Since the $95 \%$ level of confidence will be used, the diagram on the right will remind us that $95 \%$ of a normal distribution lies within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-322.jpg?height=334&width=649&top_left_y=1733&top_left_x=986)

If $\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion and $p$ is the population proportion, then the $95 \%$ confidence interval for $p$ is given by

$$
\hat{p}-1.96 \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \leqslant p \leqslant \hat{p}+1.96 \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}
$$

This can be written more concisely as $\hat{p} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$.

The 95\% confidence interval for a population proportion

$$
\hat{p} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}
$$

Note: An increase in confidence levels results in an increase in the interval width.

## Example 4

In a survey carried out in a large city, 170 households out of a random sample of 250 owned at least one pet.
(i) Find the standard error of the sampling distribution of the proportion at the 95\% confidence level.
(ii) Find the $95 \%$ confidence interval for the proportion of households in the city who own at least one pet.
(i) The sample proportion $\hat{p}=\frac{170}{250}=0.68$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Standard error } \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\hat{p}} & =\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\
& =\sqrt{\frac{0.68(1-0.68)}{250}} \ldots \text { using } \hat{p} \text { as an estimate for } p . \\
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\hat{p}} & =0.029
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) The $95 \%$ confidence interval is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \hat{p} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\
& =0.68 \pm 1.96(0.029) \ldots \text { from (i) above } \\
& =0.68 \pm 0.0568 \\
& =(0.6232,0.7368) \text { or about }(62 \%, 74 \%)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example 5

A random sample of 250 cars was surveyed passing a certain junction and 36 were found to have K registrations.
(i) Determine a $95 \%$ confidence interval for the proportion of cars in that area that have a K registration.
(ii) Nationally it is known that $14 \%$ of cars have a K registration.

What size of sample, $n$, needs to be taken so as to be $95 \%$ certain that an estimate of the proportion of K registrations is within $2 \%$ of the population proportion.
(i) The sample proportion $\hat{p}=\frac{36}{250}=0.144$.

The $95 \%$ confidence interval is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \hat{p} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\
& =0.144 \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{0.144(1-0.144)}{250}} \ldots \text { using } \hat{p} \text { as an estimate for } p . \\
& =0.144 \pm 1.96(0.0222) \\
& =0.144 \pm 0.0435 \ldots(14.4 \% \pm 4.35 \%) \\
& =0.100,0.1875
\end{aligned}
$$

The $95 \%$ confidence interval is $(0.100,0.1875)$.
(ii) Let $n$ be the size of the sample. $\quad p=14 \%=0.14$

We require $n$ such that $\hat{p} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}=\hat{p} \pm 0.02 \ldots(0.02=2 \%)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore & 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{0.14(1-0.14)}{n}}=0.02 \\
& \frac{0.14(0.86)}{n}=\left(\frac{0.02}{1.96}\right)^{2} \\
& 0.14(0.86) \times\left(\frac{1.96}{0.02}\right)^{2}=n=1156.32
\end{aligned}
$$

So a sample of 1157 would need to be taken.

## Section 10.2 Hypothesis testing for population proportion

A hypothesis is a statement or conjecture made about some statistic or characteristic of a population.
Here is an example of a hypothesis:
'A football team is most likely to concede a goal just after it has scored a goal'.
A hypothesis test is a statistical method of proving the truth or otherwise of the statement or claim.

A local council reduced the speed limit on a dangerous 8 km stretch of country road from $80 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ to $60 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$. The number of accidents on the stretch was reduced from 5 per month to 3 per month. The council claimed that the speed reduction was effective. Is the council correct in its claim?

In cases like this, a hypothesis test is set up to prove or disprove the claim.

## Procedure for carrying out a hypothesis test on a population proportion

The procedure for carrying out a hypothesis test will involve the following steps:

1. Write down $\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{0}}$, the null hypothesis, and $\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{1}}$, the alternative hypothesis

For example, to test if a coin is biased if we get 7 heads in 10 tosses, we could formulate the following hypothesis:
$\mathrm{H}_{0}$ : The coin is not biased.
$\mathrm{H}_{1}$ : The coin is biased.
2. Write down or calculate the sample proportion, $\hat{p}$.
3. Find the margin of error, $E$

From Section 10.1, we note that there are two methods for calculating the margin of error:
(i) $E=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$
(ii) $E=1.96 \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$

Unless you are asked to use method (i), the margin of error approximation, you should use the more accurate second version.
4. Write down the confidence interval for $p$, using

$$
\hat{p}-E<p<\hat{p}+E
$$

5. (i) If the value of the population proportion stated is within the confidence interval, do not reject the null hypothesis $\mathrm{H}_{0}$.
(ii) If the value of the population proportion stated is outside the confidence interval, reject the null hypothesis $\mathrm{H}_{0}$ and accept $\mathrm{H}_{1}$ (the alternative hypothesis).

Level of significance

If the population proportion, $p$, does not lie in the $95 \%$ confidence interval, it is said to be significant at the $\mathbf{5 \%}$ level of significance.

## Example 1

A drugs company produced a new pain-relieving drug for migraine sufferers and claimed that the drug had a $90 \%$ success rate. A group of doctors doubted the company's claim. They prescribed the drug for a group of 150 patients. After six months, 120 of these patients said that their migraine symptoms had been relieved by the drug.
At the $5 \%$ level of significance, can the company's claim be upheld?

1. State $\mathrm{H}_{0}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{1}$.
$\mathrm{H}_{0}$ : The success rate of the drug is $90 \%$, i.e. $p=0.9$.
$\mathrm{H}_{1}$ : The success rate of the drug is not $90 \%$, i.e. $p \neq 0.9$.
2. Sample proportion $\hat{p}=\frac{120}{150}=0.8$
3. Margin of error $=E=1.96 \sqrt{\frac{(0.8)(0.2)}{150}}=0.064$
4. Confidence interval: $\hat{p}-E<p<\hat{p}+E$

$$
\begin{aligned}
0.8-0.064 & <p<0.8+0.064 \\
0.736 & <p<0.864 \\
73.6 \% & <p<86.4 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

5. The stated population proportion, $p=0.9(90 \%)$, is not within the confidence interval.
So we reject the null hypothesis, $\mathrm{H}_{0}$, and accept the alternative hypothesis, $\mathrm{H}_{1}$. We conclude that the success rate of the drug is not $90 \%$.

## Example 2

A coin is tossed 1000 times and heads occur 520 times.
At the $95 \%$ confidence level, does the result indicate that the coin is biased?

1. $\mathrm{H}_{0}$ : The coin is not biased
$\mathrm{H}_{1}$ : The coin is biased
2. Sample proportion, $\hat{p}=\frac{520}{1000}=0.52$
3. Margin of error, $E,=1.96 \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}=1.96 \sqrt{\frac{(0.5)(0.5)}{1000}} \ldots(p=0.5)$

$$
=0.03
$$

4. Confidence interval: $\hat{p}-E<p<\hat{p}+E$

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Rightarrow \quad 0.52-0.03<p<0.52+0.03 \\
0.49<p<0.55
\end{gathered}
$$

5. Since $P($ head $)=0.5$, the population proportion $=0.5$.

The population proportion 0.5 is within the confidence interval found.
We do not reject the null hypothesis, $\mathrm{H}_{0}$, and state that the coin is not biased.

## Exercise 10.2

1. In a public opinion poll, 1000 randomly-chosen electors were asked whether they would vote for the Purple Party at the next election and 357 replied "Yes".
The leader of the Purple Party believes that the true proportion is 0.4.
At the $5 \%$ level of significance, is the leader's belief justified?
2. A large college claims that it admits equal numbers of men and women. A random sample of 500 students gave 267 men. At the $5 \%$ level of significance, is there evidence to suggest that the college is not evenly divided between men and women?
3. A die was rolled 240 times and 52 sixes were recorded.
(i) Write down the sample proportion, $\hat{p}$.
(ii) What is the margin of error?
(iii) If the dice is fair, write down the probability of throwing a 6 .
(iv) At the $95 \%$ confidence level, test the hypothesis that the dice is fair.
4. A survey in a university library revealed that $12 \%$ of returned books were overdue. After an increase in fines, a random sample of 200 returned books revealed that only 15 were overdue. The university claimed that the proportion of overdue books had changed. At the $5 \%$ level of significance, is the university's claim justified?
5. A seed company sells pansy seeds in mixed packets and claims that $20 \%$ of the resulting plants will have red flowers. A packet of seeds is sown by a gardener who finds that only 11 out of 82 plants have red flowers.
Test the company's claim at the $95 \%$ confidence level.
6. The 'Daily Mensa' claims that at least $60 \%$ of its readers have third level degrees.

In a random sample of 312 readers, there were 208 with third level degrees.
At the $5 \%$ level of significance, is the paper's claim justified?
7. A coin is tossed 500 times and heads appears 267 times.
(i) Find a $95 \%$ confidence interval for $p$, the population proportion of heads.
(ii) Based on the sample above test the null hypothesis, $\mathrm{H}_{0}$, that the coin is biased.
8. A survey proportion of $36 \%$ was obtained from a sample of size $n$.

At the $95 \%$ confidence level find the value of $n$ so that the margin of error is (i) $2 \%$. (ii) $3 \%$

## Section 10.3 Sampling distribution of the mean The central limit theorem

## The sampling distribution of the mean

If we are interested in the weights, for example, of all sixteen-year-olds in Ireland, we generally require the mean and standard deviations of these weights. We use the symbols
(i) $\mu$ to denote the population mean
(ii) $\sigma$ to denote the population standard deviation.

In such a large population it would be impossible to obtain the weight of each person and so the values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ will not be known. However, if we take a random sample of this population, we can get approximate values for $\mu$ and $\sigma$. Obviously, the larger the sample, the more accurate we would expect the approximations to be.
If we take a large number of different random samples of size $n$, each sample will have its own mean, $\bar{x}$, and standard deviation, $s$.
Some of these samples are illustrated on the right.

The different means of these samples are called the sample means.
If a large number of samples of the same
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-330.jpg?height=387&width=750&top_left_y=1584&top_left_x=879) size are taken, you get a correspondingly large number of means. These means form their own distribution giving us the distribution of sample means.
This distribution is also called the sampling distribution of the mean.
The following example illustrates the shape a distribution of sample means might take when different samples (of the same size) from a population are selected.

## Example 1

A population consists of five digits $2,4,6,8,10$.
(i) Write down all the possible samples of 2 different digits that can occur if random samples are taken.
(ii) Find the mean of each sample and plot the distribution of the sample means.
(iii) Compare the value of the mean of the sample means with the value of the population mean.
(i) The possible samples are:
$(2,4),(2,6),(2,8),(2,10),(4,6),(4,8),(4,10),(6,8),(6,10),(8,10)$
(ii) Their means are: $3,4,5,6,5,6,7,7,8,9$

The distribution of the sample means is plotted below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-331.jpg?height=326&width=525&top_left_y=801&top_left_x=367)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-331.jpg?height=329&width=527&top_left_y=802&top_left_x=1024)
(iii) The mean of the population is 6 .

The mean of the sample means is also 6 .
Thus the mean of the sample means and the population mean are equal.

If you examine the distribution of the sample means plotted on the right in the worked example above, you will notice that it begins to approximate to a normal distribution.
In this case the sample size was only 2.
However, as the sample size $n$ increases the closer the distribution will approximate to a normal distribution. Also the mean of the sampling distribution will be the same as the mean of the population.
The successive diagrams below illustrate the shape of the sampling distribution of means resulting from different-sized samples from a given population with a normal distribution.

Distribution when $n=2,5$ and 25 .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-331.jpg?height=145&width=430&top_left_y=2035&top_left_x=367)

Means of samples of size 2

Means of samples of size 5
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-331.jpg?height=376&width=164&top_left_y=1806&top_left_x=1271)

Means of samples of size 25

From the diagrams, you can see that if samples are taken from a normal population, the sampling distribution of means is normal for any sample size.
As $n$ increases, the curve representing the sampling distribution of the mean gets taller and narrower. These diagrams also show how the standard deviation decreases as $n$ increases. The sample means will be packed tightly around the population mean. The larger the samples become, the tighter the means will be packed.
From the worked example and from the three diagrams shown above, we can see that when samples are taken from a population, the sampling distribution of the mean takes on the characteristics of a normal curve as the sample size increases. This observation leads us to one of the most important theorems in statistics that is widely used in sampling. It is called the Central Limit Theorem and is stated more formally below.

The Central

If a random sample of size $n$ with mean $\bar{x}$ is taken from a population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, then
> If the sample size is large ( $n \geqslant 30$ ), the distribution of the sample means will approximate to a normal distribution regardless of what the population distribution is.
> The mean of the distribution will be the same as the population mean $\mu$.
Limit
> The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (denoted by $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$ ) is
Theorem given by $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. $\left[\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right.$ is often referred to as the standard error of the mean.]

As $n$ increases, the standard error gets smaller.
> If the underlying population is normal, the sampling distribution of the mean will always have a normal distribution even if the sample size is small $(<30)$.

The diagram on the right illustrates how the distribution of the sample mean approximates to a normal distribution even when the underlying population is skewed.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-332.jpg?height=418&width=493&top_left_y=1488&top_left_x=904)

When dealing with the sampling distribution of the mean, we convert the given units to standard units using the formula given on the right.

$$
z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\sigma_{\bar{x}}}=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$

## Example 2

A random sample of 250 is selected from a population having mean 30 and standard deviation 5.
Find the probability that the sample mean is greater than 30.5 .
Since $n=250$, the sample mean is normally distributed since $n \geqslant 30$.
Changing to standard units we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}=\frac{30.5-30}{\frac{5}{\sqrt{250}}}=\frac{0.5}{0.3162}=1.581 \\
& z=1.581
\end{aligned}
$$

Now

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\bar{x}>30.5) & =P(Z>1.581) \\
& =1-P(Z \leqslant 1.581) \\
& =1-0.9429 \\
& =0.0571
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-333.jpg?height=288&width=569&top_left_y=667&top_left_x=974)

The probability that the mean is greater than 30.5 is 0.0571 .

## Example 3

A normal distribution has a mean of 40 and a standard deviation of 4 .
If 25 items are drawn at random, find the probability that their mean lies between 38 and 40.5.

Converting the given units to standard units we get:

$$
z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$

For $\bar{x}=38, \quad z=\frac{38-40}{\frac{4}{\sqrt{25}}}=\frac{-2}{0.8}=-2.5$
For $\bar{x}=40.5, \quad z=\frac{40.5-40}{\frac{4}{\sqrt{25}}}=\frac{0.5}{0.8}=0.625$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-333.jpg?height=346&width=732&top_left_y=1482&top_left_x=855)

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(38<\bar{x}<40.5) & =P(-2.5<Z<0.625) \\
& =P(Z<0.625)-P(Z<-2.5) \\
& =P(Z \leqslant 0.625)-[1-P(Z \leqslant 2.5)] \\
& =0.7324-[1-0.99379] \\
& =0.7324-[0.00621] \\
& =0.7262
\end{aligned}
$$

$\Rightarrow P($ mean lies between 38 and 40.5 $)=0.7262$.

## Example 4

A population is normally distributed with mean 12 and standard deviation 3. Find the sample size such that $P(\bar{x}>12.5)=0.05$, where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \begin{aligned}
P\left(Z>z_{1}\right) & =0.05 \\
\Rightarrow P\left(Z \leqslant z_{1}\right) & =0.95 \\
\Rightarrow z_{1} & =1.645 \\
z_{1}=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} & \Rightarrow 1.645=\frac{12.5-12}{\frac{3}{\sqrt{n}}} \\
\Rightarrow & 1.645=\frac{\sqrt{n}(12.5-12)}{3} \\
& \Rightarrow \sqrt{n}=\frac{(1.645) 3}{0.5} \\
& \Rightarrow n=97.42 \text { i.e. } 98 \quad \text {... round up }
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

The required sample size is 98 .

## Example 5

A company installs new machines for packing peanuts.
The company claims that the machines fill packets with a mean mass of 500 g and a standard deviation of 18 g .
To test the company's claim several samples of size 40 packets are taken and their mean masses, $\bar{x}$ grams, are recorded.
(i) Describe the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ and explain your answer, referring to the theorem you have used.
(ii) Write down the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of $\bar{x}$.
(iii) Draw a rough sketch of the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$.
(iv) Find the probability that the mean of the distribution of $\bar{x}$ is less than 496 .
(v) What sample size $n$ is required so that $P(\bar{x}>503)=0.06$ ?
(i) The sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is approximately normal as the sample size of 40 is sufficiently large (i.e. $\geqslant 30$ ) to apply The Central Limit Theorem.
(ii) The mean of the distribution of the sample means is 500 g , the same as the population mean.
The standard deviation (or standard error) is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}=\frac{18}{\sqrt{40}}=2.846$ $=2.85$
(iii) A sketch of the distribution of $\bar{x}$ is shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-335.jpg?height=335&width=553&top_left_y=297&top_left_x=365)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mu=500 \\
& \sigma=2.85
\end{aligned}
$$

(iv) Converting the given units to $z$-scores, we use $z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$. For $\bar{x}=496, z=\frac{496-500}{\frac{18}{\sqrt{40}}}=\frac{-4}{2.846}=-1.405$

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\bar{x}<496) & =P(Z<-1.405) \\
& =1-P(Z \leqslant 1.405) \\
& =1-0.9265 \\
& =0.0735
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-335.jpg?height=218&width=482&top_left_y=872&top_left_x=1060)

The probability that $\bar{x}<496=0.0735$ or $7.35 \%$.
(v) $P\left(Z>z_{1}\right)=0.06$
$P\left(Z \leqslant z_{1}\right)=1-0.06=0.94$

$$
\Rightarrow z_{1}=1.56
$$

$z_{1}=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \Rightarrow 1.56=\frac{503-500}{\frac{18}{\sqrt{n}}}=\frac{3 \sqrt{n}}{18}=\frac{\sqrt{n}}{6}$

$$
\begin{align*}
& \Rightarrow 1.56=\frac{\sqrt{n}}{6} \\
& \Rightarrow \sqrt{n}=6(1.56)=9.36 \\
& \Rightarrow n=(9.36)^{2} \\
& \Rightarrow n=87.6=88 \quad \text {... round up } \tag{round up}
\end{align*}
$$

The sample size required is 88 .

## Section 10.4 Confidence interval for a population mean

In Section 10.3, the Central Limit Theorem was used to show that the sampling distribution of the mean approximates to a normal distribution for large $n(n \geqslant 30)$. In this section we introduce a different way of presenting information provided by a sample mean to estimate the mean of the population from which the sample came.

If samples of size $n$ are taken from a population, the means of the samples will vary. To accommodate this variety, we introduce (as before for proportions) the concept of a confidence interval for the mean.
The endpoints of this interval are called confidence limits.
The degree of confidence is generally given as a percentage.
These percentages are generally $90 \%, 95 \%$ and $99 \%$.
Note: As the confidence level increases $90 \%-95 \%-99 \%$ the confidence interval widens.
In the standard normal distribution, we require the values of $z_{1}$ such that $95 \%$ of the population lies in the interval $-z_{1} \leqslant Z \leqslant z_{1}$.
The work involved in finding the value of $z_{1}$, is shown below.
We use the standard normal tables on pages 36 and 37 of Formulae and Tables.
From the given diagram,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{P}\left(Z \leqslant z_{1}\right) & =0.95+0.025 \\
& =0.975
\end{aligned}
$$

From the tables

$$
\begin{aligned}
z_{1} & =1.96 \\
\Rightarrow-z_{1} & =-1.96
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-338.jpg?height=341&width=654&top_left_y=1720&top_left_x=823)

Thus in the normal distribution, $95 \%$ of the population lies within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean.

If $\mu$ is the population mean, then $95 \%$ of the sample means lie in the interval
$\bar{x}-1.96 \sigma_{\bar{x}}<\mu<\bar{x}+1.96 \sigma_{\bar{x}}$, where $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$ is the standard error of the mean.
and $\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \sigma$ being the standard deviation of the population.

$$
\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

This can be written as $\bar{x} \pm 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, which are the end-points (or confidence limits) of the mean.

Confidence
Interval
for Mean

If $\bar{x}$ is the mean of a random sample of size $n$ taken from a population with a distribution with known standard deviation $\sigma$, then the end-points of the $95 \%$ confidence interval for $\mu$, the population mean, are given by

$$
\bar{x} \pm 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Note: If $\sigma$, the standard deviation of the population, is not given, use the standard deviation, $s$, of the sample as an approximation.

## Example 1

A random sample of 400 oranges was taken from a large consignment with unknown mean $\mu$ and standard deviation 15 grams.
The mean weight of the random sample was 81.4 grams.
Find a $95 \%$ confidence interval for the mean weight of the oranges in the consignment.

The $95 \%$ confidence interval for $\mu$ is $\bar{x} \pm 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{x} \pm 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} & =81.4 \pm 1.96\left(\frac{15}{\sqrt{400}}\right) \ldots \sigma=15 \text { and } n=400 \\
& =81.4 \pm 1.96(0.75) \\
& =81.4 \pm 1.47 \\
& =79.93,82.87 \\
& \Rightarrow 79.93<\mu<82.87
\end{aligned}
$$

The mean of the consignment lies between 79.93 g and 82.87 g .

## Example 2

A certain type of tennis ball is known to have a height of bounce which is normally distributed with standard deviation 2 cm .
A sample of 60 such tennis balls is tested and the mean height of the bounce of the sample is 140 cm .
(i) Find a $95 \%$ confidence interval for the mean height of the bounce of this type of tennis ball.
(ii) Explain what is meant by a " $95 \%$ confidence interval".
(i) The $95 \%$ confidence interval is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \bar{x} \pm 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \\
= & 140 \pm 1.96\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{60}}\right) \\
= & 140 \pm 1.96(0.258) \\
= & 140 \pm 0.506 \\
= & 140.506 \mathrm{~cm}, 139.494 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}
$$

The $95 \%$ confidence interval is $140.506 \mathrm{~cm}<\mu<139.494 \mathrm{~cm}$.
(ii) A " $95 \%$ confidence interval", means that on 95 occasions out of 100 the interval will contain the true population mean.

## Example 3

The heights of people have a standard deviation of 11.5 cm .
It is required to estimate the mean height of people, with $95 \%$ confidence, to within $\pm 0.4 \mathrm{~cm}$.
What sample size should be taken in order to achieve this estimate?
Let $\mu$ be the mean height of people.
The $95 \%$ confidence limits for $\mu$ are $\bar{x} \pm 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \pm 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}= \pm 0.4 \ldots \text { standard error is } \pm 0.4 \mathrm{~cm} \\
& \Rightarrow 1.96\left(\frac{11.5}{\sqrt{n}}\right)=0.4 \\
& \Rightarrow \sqrt{n}=\frac{11.5(1.96)}{0.4} \\
& \Rightarrow \sqrt{n}=56.35 \\
& \Rightarrow n=(56.35)^{2}=3175.3
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, a sample of at least 3176 should be taken.

## Example 4

On the basis of the results obtained from a random sample of 100 men from a particular district, the $95 \%$ confidence interval for the mean height of the men in the district is found to be ( $177.22 \mathrm{~cm}, 179.18 \mathrm{~cm}$ ).
Find the value of $\bar{x}$, the mean of the sample, and $\sigma$, the standard deviation of the normal population from which the sample is drawn.

The $95 \%$ confidence interval is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{x} \pm 1.96 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} & =(177.22,179.18) \\
\Rightarrow \bar{x}+1.96 \frac{\sigma}{10} & =179.18 \ldots \text { (1) } \\
\text { and } \bar{x}-1.96 \frac{\sigma}{10} & =177.22 \ldots \text { (2) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Adding (1) and (2): $2 \bar{x}=356.4$

$$
\bar{x}=178.2
$$

Subtracting (1) and (2):

$$
\begin{aligned}
2(1.96) \frac{\sigma}{10} & =1.96 \\
\frac{2 \sigma}{10} & =1 \Rightarrow \sigma=5
\end{aligned}
$$

The sample mean $\bar{x}=178.2 \mathrm{~cm}$.
The population standard deviation is 5 cm .

## Section 10.5 Hypothesis testing for a population mean

## Hypothesis testing

In Sections 10.1 and 10.4 we dealt with confidence intervals, one of the two most common types of statistical inference.
As we have seen in Section 10.2 the second type of statistical inference is hypothesis testing.
The procedure for performing a hypothesis test on a population mean ( $\mu$ ) is similar to the procedure for performing a hypothesis test on a population proportion ( $p$ ) (Section 10.2).

It has already been shown that in any normal distribution $95 \%$ of the population lies within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, that is, $95 \%$ of the population will be in the interval $\mu \pm 1.96 \sigma$.

If we are dealing with a normal distribution and an experiment produces a result which is outside the interval $\mu \pm 1.96 \sigma$, we would be inclined to suspect that factors other than chance are involved in the result.

To test the result we start with the assumption, or hypothesis, that the result is not biased. This assumption is called the null hypothesis, denoted by $\mathbf{H}_{0}$.
Usually the null hypothesis is a statement of "no difference", "no effect" or "no change".
An hypothesis test is then carried out to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.
In this test, we speak of rejecting the null hypothesis 'at a certain level'.
This 'certain level' is called the level of significance.
The $5 \%$ level of significance creates a $95 \%$ confidence interval.
The $5 \%$ level of significance means that the result obtained is likely to occur on only 5 occasions out of 100 .

At the $5 \%$ level of significance, the set of values, $z>1.96$ or $z<-1.96$, is known as the critical region and the boundaries of the critical region are called the critical values.

If the values of $z$ are in the critical region (i.e. $z>1.96$ or $z<-1.96$ ), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that factors other than chance are involved.

The critical regions at the $5 \%$ level of significance are shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-344.jpg?height=343&width=843&top_left_y=446&top_left_x=498)

Hypothesis
Testing

At the $5 \%$ level of significance, the null hypothesis is rejected if

$$
z<-1.96 \text { or } z>1.96
$$

## Hypothesis testing for a population mean

When a population is very large, it is generally not practical to find the true mean and standard deviation of the total population. However, assumptions are often made about these values and their validity is tested based on observations made from random samples taken from the population.

Take, for example, machines designed to produce batteries which last for 120 hours with a standard deviation 4 hours. What conclusions can we come to about one of these machines if a random sample of 50 batteries produced by it had a mean life of 121 hours?

We now begin the process of investigating whether these machines are producing the type of battery they were designed to produce. This process is called hypothesis testing.

Here are the basic steps of a hypothesis test:

1. Write down $\mathbf{H}_{0}$, the null hypothesis, and $\mathbf{H}_{1}$, the alternative hypothesis.
$\mathbf{H}_{0}$ : The mean life of a battery is 120 hours.
$\mathbf{H}_{1}$ : The mean life of a battery is not 120 hours.
2. State the significance level, $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$.

The significance level on our course is 5\% ( $\alpha=0.05$ ).
This means that if $z<-1.96$ or $z>1.96$, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.
3. Calculate the value of the test statistic.

This involves converting the given units to $z$-units.

To convert the given units to standard units we use

$$
z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}, \text { where }
$$

$\bar{x}=$ the sample mean
$\mu=$ population mean
$\sigma=$ population standard deviation
$n=$ size of sample
For the machine mentioned above,

$$
z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}=\frac{121-120}{\frac{4}{\sqrt{50}}}=\frac{1}{0.566}=1.767
$$

The test statistic is $z=1.767$.
4. Come to a conclusion.

Since $z=1.767$ does not lie outside the range $-1.96<z<1.96$ it is not in the critical region.
So we do not reject the null hypothesis and states that the mean life of a battery is 120 hours.

Note: If $\sigma$, the standard deviation of the population is not given, use $s$ the standard deviation of the sample instead.

## Example 1

Over the years, a market gardener found that the mean yield from his tomato plants was 1.83 kg per plant with a standard deviation of 0.35 kg per plant. One year he planted 600 of a new variety and these yielded 1.87 kg per plant. At the $5 \%$ level of significance, test whether the mean yield from the new plants is different from his normal variety.

1. $\mathrm{H}_{0}$ : The mean $\mu$ is 1.83.
$\mathrm{H}_{1}$ : The mean $\mu$ is not 1.83.
2. The level of significance is $5 \%$.

The critical region is $z<-1.96$ or $z>1.96$.
3. Calculate the test statistic by converting to standard units.

$$
\begin{aligned}
z & =\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \ldots \begin{array}{l}
\bar{x}=1.87 \\
n=600
\end{array} \\
& =\frac{1.87-1.83}{\left(\frac{0.35}{\sqrt{600}}\right)}=\frac{0.04}{0.0143}=2.797 \\
z & =2.797
\end{aligned}
$$

4. Since $z=2.797$ and $2.797>1.96$, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the new variety is different from the normal variety.

## Using $\boldsymbol{p}$-values

Suppose we carry out an hypothesis test and find the test statistic to be $z=2.16$.
Since 2.16 is greater than 1.96 , we reject the null hypothesis at the $5 \%$ level of significance ( $\alpha=0.05$ ).

Instead of comparing $z=2.16$ with $z=1.96$ (and $z=-1.96$ ), we could compare the total area of the two coloured regions below with the specific level of significance, $\alpha=0.05$.

We use pages 36 and 37 of Formulae and Tables to find the probability that $z \leqslant-2.16$ or $z \geqslant 2.16$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{P}(Z \leqslant-2.16)+\mathrm{P}(Z \geqslant 2.16) \\
& =2 \mathrm{P}(Z \geqslant 2.16) \\
& =2[1-\mathrm{P}(Z \leqslant 2.16)] \\
& =2[1-0.9846] \\
& =2[0.0154] \\
& =0.0308
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-346.jpg?height=333&width=737&top_left_y=522&top_left_x=876)

The shaded areas above are referred to as the $\boldsymbol{p}$-value, or probability-value corresponding to the observed value of the test statistic.
The value 0.0308 found above is the $p$-value that corresponds to the test statistic $z=2.16$. The $p$-value 0.0308 is interpreted as the lowest level of significance at which the null hypothesis could have been rejected.

With a test statistic of $z=2.16(p$-value $=0.0308)$, we would certainly have rejected the null hypothesis at the specified level of significance ( $\alpha=0.05$ ).
The $p$-value of 0.0308 gives us a specific or more precise level of significance.
The smaller the $p$-value is, the stronger is the evidence against $\mathrm{H}_{0}$ provided by the data.

The $p$-value of a Test Statistic
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_07_30_8707c24399a8bd6d62d8g-346.jpg?height=333&width=640&top_left_y=1550&top_left_x=576)

The $p$-value is the sum of the two shaded areas.

$$
p \text {-value }=2 \times \mathrm{P}(Z>|z|),
$$

where $z$ is the test statistic.

## Example 2

Calculate the $p$-value for the sample statistic $z=-2.08$.
Sample statistic is $z=-2.08$.
The sum of the probabilities that

$$
z>2.08 \text { and } z<-2.08
$$

is the $p$-value.

$$
\begin{aligned}
p \text {-value } & =2 \times \mathrm{P}(Z>|2.08|) \\
& =2 \times[1-\mathrm{P}(Z \leqslant 2.08)] \\
& =2 \times[1-0.9812] \\
& =2(0.0188) \\
p \text {-value } & =0.0376
\end{aligned}
$$

## Steps involved in a test of significance using a $p$-value

1. Write down the null hypothesis $\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{0}}$ and the alternative hypothesis $\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{1}}$.
2. State the significance level $\alpha$. (On our course $\alpha=0.05$.)
3. Calculate the test statistic.
4. Find the $p$-value that corresponds to the test statistic.
5. If the $p$-value $>0.05$, the result is not significant and we do not reject the null hypothesis $\mathrm{H}_{0}$.

If the $p$-value $\leqslant 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis $\mathrm{H}_{0}$ in favour of the alternative hypothesis $\mathrm{H}_{1}$.

## Example 3

A random sample of 36 observations is to be taken from a distribution with standard deviation 10 . In the past, the distribution has had a mean of 83 , but it is believed that the mean may have changed.
When the sample was taken it was found to have a mean of 86.2.
(i) State $\mathrm{H}_{0}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{1}$.
(ii) Calculate the value of the test statistic.
(iii) Calculate the $p$-value for the test statistic.
(iv) Use the $p$-value to state if the result is significant at the $5 \%$ level of significance.
Explain your conclusion.
(i) $\mathrm{H}_{0}:$ Mean $\mu=83$
$\mathrm{H}_{1}$ : Mean $\mu \neq 83$
(ii) Test statistic $z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$

$$
z=\frac{86.2-83}{\frac{10}{\sqrt{36}}}=\frac{3.2 \times \sqrt{36}}{10}=1.92
$$

The test statistic is $z=1.92$
(iii) The $p$-value $=2 \times \mathrm{P}(Z>1.92)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =2 \times[1-\mathrm{P}(Z \leqslant 1.92)] \\
& =2 \times[1-0.9726] \\
& =2(0.0274)=0.0548
\end{aligned}
$$

(iv) As the $p$-value is not less than or equal to 0.05 , the result is not significant; we do not reject the null hypothesis.

## Exercise 10.5

1. A normal distribution is thought to have a mean of 50 .

2. Over a long period the scores obtained in a particular intelligence test were normally distributed with mean score 70 and standard deviation 6.

64 of these mice, selected at random, were each given a measured dose of a certain drug each day, and the mean lifespan for this group was 269 days.
At the $5 \%$ level of significance, is there evidence to suggest that the drug has altered the mean lifespan of the mice?
